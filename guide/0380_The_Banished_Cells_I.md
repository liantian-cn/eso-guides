## 放逐地牢 I

> The Banished Cells I




### 地牢怒灵

> Cell Haunter


** 地牢怒灵 **

首先，你会面临两个骷髅，一个拿着剑盾，另一个使用近战武器。确保不要在剑盾骷髅举盾格挡时进行重击，否则他会打破你的平衡，并且必须格挡这些特定敌人的重击，如果你是不幸的目标。让你的坦克同时吸引两个敌人的注意力，并将BOSS背对小队。

攻略翻译如下：
很关键的一点是，BOSS需要面向团队外侧，这样寒冰风暴法术就不会击中他们了。

两个小怪应该被AOE伤害消灭，同时DPS玩家集中攻击Boss。

* **魔法飞弹** :  地牢怒灵将对坦克（或获得仇恨的玩家）连续释放2-4次轻度冰攻击。此后将有两种攻击方式之一。这些攻击可以被格挡，对坦克的威胁不是很大。

* **生命汲取寒冬之触** :  这个技能有咏唱时间并且可以被打断。如果没有及时打断，他将向目标方向施放一个小的冰龙卷技能（因此它必须被背对着小队，否则其他队员也会被击中）。这个特殊攻击非常强，可以几乎一击杀死一个dps角色，并且会使目标/们在冰中短暂固定几秒钟（除非你挣脱它）。

* **吸血耗血——地牢怒灵的主要攻击和最具毁灭性的技能如果没有防御治疗或攻击则会将治疗输出玩家的整个生命条削减这个首领会将一束能量束附加到其选择的目标上（随机）并吸取其生命值同时恢复自己的健康这个技能是不可中断的并需要治疗师集中注意力关注受害者和或输出玩家自己在这个阶段内进行护盾或治疗这个阶段只有3** : 4秒钟，但伤害值很高。





### 影裂

> Shadowrend


攻略如下： **影刃**

这个惊惧兽类的BOSS可能是这个地下城中最简单的之一，因为可以很容易地将它保持在一个位置上，没有太多麻烦，而当人们开始在房间里四处奔跑时，危险就来了。没有必要逃跑。从房间的正中心开始，你的坦克应该一直把它留在那里。除了基本的对坦克的轻攻击外，它还有3个主要的机制。

* **影子克隆** :  影子魔在形成一个影子副本的同时产生了一个阴影，它造成与首领相同的伤害，但它的血量非常少。尽快击杀它，以免成为问题，并且要靠近它，否则影子魔会跳跃。注意保持站位。

* **冲锋并吞噬** :  如果有人移开了Boss(大约超过10米+), Shadowrend会向一个随机目标(不一定是最远的)发起攻击并开始咀嚼他的受害者造成巨大伤害。必须打断Shadowrend的攻击才能停止它的攻击。关键是不要跑开，留在中间，这样它就永远不会发动攻击。

攻略翻译如下：
**尾扫** —— 这是它最强的一击，也是最容易躲避的。它会向周围360度摆动尾巴，任何被困在范围内的人都会受到严重的打击，并被撞倒。有两种方法可以避免被攻击……稍微走出范围以外，或者格挡。无论哪种方式都可以，而且当格挡时伤害最小。最重要的是：不要逃跑！很简单。





### 惊惧兽操控者安嘉塔

> Angata the Clannfear Handler


** 惊惧兽操控者安嘉塔 **

这里是
在这场战斗中，惊惧兽操控者本身并不是问题，问题在于房间里的敌人数量多得惊人。你必须让你的坦克去嘲讽/绑定/抓住尽可能多的敌人，尤其是远程法师类型的敌人。如果他们都集中攻击DPS或治疗者，他们将在一瞬间死亡。所以坦克总是要先进入房间。尽可能多地将目标绑定在BOSS身上，并将她转过身去，远离小队。用AOE伤害燃烧掉BOSS旁边的任何敌人，如果你必须要做到，集中攻击远程目标，并注意打断技能。

* **Summon Clanfear** :  大约每10秒钟她会召唤一只惊惧兽。它们并不难杀，但会像其他惊惧兽一样进行恶心的轻型攻击，有一个跳跃机制和尾部扫打。因此不要逃跑，否则它会追捕你。尽可能靠近boss杀死它。惊惧兽的召唤可以被打断。

* **AOE Fire** :  安嘉塔有时会举起她的法杖，对地面施放一个小范围的火焰AOE，这是非常简单的机制，只要不要站在里面即可。当它落地时，移动几英尺出来就行了。这个技能可以被打断。

她的其他攻击基本都是轻型的火焰攻击，只要坦克在她的嘲讽范围内，就应该可以应对。





### 骷髅毁灭者

> Skeletal Destroyer


** 骷髅毁灭者 **

这个Boss看起来比它实际上要可怕得多，这是需要控制Boss和房间内的敌人的情况。房间里有4只Scamps，嘲讽Boss后，坦克应该专注于尽可能拉近这些敌人到Boss的附近。如果这不可能，那么嘲讽是可以的，但是DPS必须将它们集中攻击。迅速击败它们，注意它们的地面火攻击，并确保在它们施法时打断它们。一旦它们挂了，就很顺利了，只需让Boss保持在中心不动，并让每个人远离它的脸部。同样，如果你已经成为Boss仇恨的目标，不要逃跑。

* **召唤骷髅** :  大约每10秒钟，他会召唤3只骷髅，它们相对较弱，可以用大多数范围伤害杀死，但你要专注于对它们造成伤害，因为如果你杀死它们不够快，它们会爆炸。一旦它们死亡，10秒计时器重新开始直到下一波。

* **践踏** :  这是他的脚周围非常明显的aoe(范围伤害)圆圈，他会踩地，然后快速地向他的目标方向拍打。如果你是DPS，只需向后退几步，远离这个范围即可。如果你是坦克或不幸被卷入其中...只需格挡，不要跑开！

* **横劈** :  这个技能非常简单，只会对坦克造成威胁，如果你是输出或治疗职业，保持在boss身后，偶尔boss会朝着威胁它的人的方向发动一个锥形攻击，也就是一次横劈。作为坦克，只需要防御即可。如果你很不幸成为它的攻击目标但你不是坦克，同样的方法适用于你，不要逃跑，只需要防御即可。





### 利里斯亲王

> HIGH KINLORD RILIS


** 利里斯亲王高级族长 **

在被放逐的牢房的最终Boss。他的机制很简单，但他的攻击却非常强大！最容易的坦克位置是在房间最远的角落里，这意味着治疗他的餐食需要走更远的距离，更容易管理。他的攻击时间有些随机，但在某个时刻你必须密切关注以避免几乎必定死亡。坦克应该能够站在原地与他对峙，但请注意如果你移动Boss，请确保让他保持在任何友方挥洒伤害的范围内，以便他能继续失血。在房间里到处乱跑是不会有帮助的。

* **攻略翻译如下

盛宴** :  每隔几秒钟，一个盛宴（治疗珠）将在BOSS最开始的地方出现。它们将缓慢飘向BOSS，无论他在哪里，你必须尽快击杀它们。不要让它们到达BOSS，否则他将恢复大量的生命值。在困难模式下，他有500万生命值，确保他不会恢复。

* **幽灵之火** :  这项能力是一系列令人不爽的地面火圈。他会举起剑并在地面上依次放置4个火圈。只需要躲开它们并注意脚下。不要从战斗中逃离，只需要每次移动几步，或者进行翻滚以躲避火圈。注意不要踩到地面的火圈里。

* **重击** :  这是他的重型攻击。跟游戏中其他敌人一样，它会有简单的重型攻击提示（他身上的白色/黄色闪光）。作为坦克，请一定要格挡这一攻击。如果不格挡，你将遭受巨大的伤害，如果dps被这个攻击命中而没有格挡，那么他一定会被一击必杀。它的伤害非常高。如果你是dps，而攻击正朝着你而来，请务必格挡它。如果你是满血状态，你几乎可以挺过它，如果不是，你就死定了。

* **魔法箭矢** :  这种类似火球的能力可能是他最危险的机制之一，除了重攻击之外，因为它非常强大、快速、很难避免。在他进行幽灵之火或重攻击后，他将随机选择一个玩家扔一个魔法箭矢。如果你没有坚实的抵抗力、伤害护盾或足够的生命值，这几乎保证了对一个输出或治疗来说将立刻致命。所以你必须阻挡或翻滚来躲避这个机制。保持生命的最安全的方法是每次看到他举起剑（幽灵之火机制）或重攻击（重击机制）时，都要持续阻止，直到你看到他进行魔法箭矢攻击（类似火球）。然而，如果幽灵之火能力已经被释放，你仍然必须踏出火焰，同时准备阻止。避免这个机制是一次完全失败和成功通关之间的区别，因为如果有人死了，这就非常难恢复。

> ** CELL HAUNTER **
> 
> Firstly you will have two skeletons to deal with, one with a sword n board and the other with a melee weapon. Be sure not to heavy attack the sword and board skeleton while he is blocking else he will knock you off balance, and be sure to block the heavy attacks of these particular enemies if you are the unlucky target. Get your tank to put both enemies on the boss while turning the boss away from the group.
> 
> It is KEY that the boss faces away from the group so that the Ice Tornado spell doesn't hit them.
> 
> The 2 adds/enemies should die to AOE (area of effect) damage while the DPS players focus down the boss.
> 
> **Magic Missile** - The Cell haunter himself will hit the tank (or whoever has agro) with a barrage of light ice attacks, usually between 2-4 in a row. After this one of two attacks will follow. These can be blocked and don't hit the tank too hard.
> 
> **Health leech/Winter's Reach** - Has a cast time and can be interrupted. If NOT interrupted in time, it will result in him casting a small ice tornado looking ability in the target's direction (hence why this must be turned away from the group, the other members can be hit too). This particular attack hits VERY hard, can almost one shot a dps character and will immobilize the target/s in ice for a few seconds (unless you break out of it).
> 
> **Health leech/Drain** - Cell Haunter's main attack and most devastating ability if not managed with blocks/shields/heals can strip a healer/dps player of their entire health bar. The boss with attach a beam of energy to its chosen target (this is random) and will drain it's life while healing itself. This ability is NOT interruptible and requires the healer to be on point and focus the victim and/or the dps player themselves to shield or heal during this phase. It is only about 3-4seconds long but the damage ticks are quite large.

> ** SHADOWREND **
> 
> This clanfear type boss is possibly one of the simplest in this dungeon since he can be held simply in one place without much trouble, the danger is when people start running around the room. There is NO need to run. Start with him dead center of the room and your tank should hold him there at all times. He has 3 major mechanics apart from his basic light attacks on the tank.
> 
> **Shadow clone** - Shadowrend spawns a duplicate in the form of a shadow of itself, it hits for the same damage as the boss but has a TINY amount of health. Kill this as fast as possible so it doesn't become a problem and STAY CLOSE or he will jump.
> 
> **Charge and devour** - IF someone moves away from the boss (roughly more than 10meters+) Shadowrend will launch at a random target, not always the furthest away) and start chewing on his victim causing huge damage. Shadowrend has to be interupted to stop his attack. Key to this is, DON'T run, stay in the middle, then he will never do it.
> 
> **Tail swipe** - This is his strongest hit and easiest to avoid. He will do a 360 degree tail whip and anyone caught inside of the aoe will be hit hard, and knocked down. Two ways to avoid it... Step slightly out of the circle, OR block. Either works fine and while blocking the damage is minimal. Key point above all, do not run! Simple.

> ** ANGATA THE CLANNFEAR HANDLER **
> 
> The clanfear handler herself is not so much the problem in this fight, the problem is the sheer amount of enemies in the room. You MUST get your tank to taunt/chain/pin as many as possible ESPECIALLY the ranged mage typoes. If they all focus a dps or healer they will die in a split second. So tank ALWAYS enters the room first. Pin as many targets on the boss as possible and turn her around away from the group. Burn down any enemies next to the boss with AOE damage and if you have to, focus the ranged targets and pay attention to interrupts.
> 
> **Summon Clanfear** - Every 10 seconds or so she will summon a single clanfear. They are not hard to kill but they do act as any other clan fear with nasty light attacks, a jump mechanic and tail swipe. So do not run away or it will hunt you down. Kill this as close to the boss as possible. The casting of the clanfear can be interrupted.
> 
> **AOE Fire** - Angata occasionally raises her staff and causes a small round aoe of fire on the ground, this is a very simple mechanic, just don't stand in it. Move a couple of feet out of it as it lands and you will be fine. This can be interrupted.
> 
> The rest of her attacks are mostly light flame attacks and should be manageable so long as the tank has her taunted.

> 
> This Boss is a lot scarier to look at than he is, it is a case of having control of the boss and the enemies in the room. There are 4x Scamps around the room, after taunting the boss the tank should focus on pulling these in as close to the boss as possible. If this isnt possible then taunts are fine but the dps will have to focus them down. Kill them fast, watch their ground fire attacks and be sure to interrupt them if they are casting. Once they are down it is pretty smooth, just keep the boss still in the center and have everyone stay AWAY from his face. Again, don't run away if you have agro.
> 
> **Summon skeletons** - Every 10 seconds or so he will summon a set of 3x skeletons, they are relatively weak and can be killed with most aoe damage however you do want to focus these because if you don't kill them fast enough they will explode. Once they die, the timer from 10seconds starts again until the next wave.
> 
> **Stomp** - This is a very obvious aoe circle around his feet where he stomps the ground followed by a quick slap in the direction of his target. Simply stay out of this if you are a dps by taking a couple of steps back. If you are a tank or you get unlucky and caught in it...simply block, no running away!
> 
> **Cleave** - This one is very simple and should only really be affecting the tank, stay behind the boss if you are dps or healer and occasionally the boss will do a cone type attack in the form of a Cleave at the direction of the person who he is agroing. As the tank, all you have to do here is block. IF you are unlucky enough to have it attack you and you are NOT a tank, same applies..do NOT run, just block.

> The final boss in banished cells. He has simple mechanics BUT he hits like a steam train! The easiest position for tanking him to start with is in the furthest corner of the room, this means the feasts that heal him have further to go and are easier to manage. His attacks are somewhat random timing wise but there is a window where you must pay close attention to avoid an almost guaranteed one shot. The tank should be able to tank him MOSTLY on the spot but be aware if you do move the boss be sure to keep him in any friendly aoe damage so he can continue to loose health. Running around the room will NOT help.
> 
> **Feasts** - Every few seconds a feast (healing orb) will spawn where the boss first started. They will float slowly to him no matter where he is and you must kill these as fast as possible. Do NOT let them reach him else he will heal for massive amounts of health. He has 5million health to start with on hard mode, make sure he doesn't heal.
> 
> **Ghost fire** - This ability is a barrage of nasty ground based fire aoes. He will raise his sword and place 4 pools on the ground one after another. Simply move out of them and watch your feet. Do not run away from the boss fight as such, just move a couple of feet at a time, or dodge roll to get out of the fire.
> 
> **Heavy blow** - This is his heavy attack. Simple heavy attack indicator like any enemy in the game for this one (white/yellowy flash from his body) be sure as the tank to BLOCK THIS. If you do not it will hurt a HUGE amount and if a dps gets hit with this without blocking, it is a one shot guaranteed. It hits INCREDIBLY hard. If you are a dps and it is coming for you, be sure to block it. If you are max health you will just about survive it, if not, you are dead.
> 
> **Magic bolt** - This fireball type ability is possibly his most dangerous mechanic aside form the heavy attack because it is powerful, fast, and very hard to avoid. After he does his Ghost fire or heavy attack he will RANDOMLY select a player to throw a magic bolt at. If you don't have solid resists, a damage shield or enough health in your bar this will almost guarantee a one shot to a dps or healer. SO you MUST block or dodge roll this mechanic. The safest way to stay alive is each time you see him raise his sword (Ghost fire Mechanic) OR heavy attack (Heavy Blow mechanic) hold block until you see him do the Magic Bolt (like a fire ball). Be aware however if the Ghost Fire ability has been cast you will still have to step out of the fire, while being ready to block. Avoiding this mechanic is the difference between a wipe and a pass because if people die this is VERY hard to recovery from.
