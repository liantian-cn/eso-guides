### 黏液之胃

> Slimecraw


SLIMECRAW（史莱姆鳞）

这个BOSS非常简单，机制也很少。正如你所期望的，地牢的第一只BOSS并不算特别具有挑战性。然而，仍然需要遵循机制，主要是关于坦克。嘲讽BOSS，让它背对小队，并保持不动。

“咬” — 非常标准的轻攻击类型。这会造成小量伤害，坦克可以格挡，但通常不是必须的。坦克可以轻松抵挡这些攻击，然而没有治疗的DPS如果被咬太多次会造成问题。这应该只会打在具有仇恨的人身上（坦克），所以坦克应该不断保持嘲讽以避免任何问题。

* **尾部猛击** :  这个机制非常简单。Boss会卷起重击并显示锥形AOE视觉效果。这是你格挡的时机！如果你不格挡，你会被甩到房间的另一侧，Boss会追上来并咬你一口。坦克可以轻松应对这个机制，但是如果没有格挡，DPS或治疗可能会受到相当大的伤害。关键点是作为坦克要让Boss保持静止，并始终格挡这个机制。当然这非常简单，但如果你不这么做，Boss会有点狂奔，留下地面DPS技能，人们必须想办法在其他位置重新施加伤害。此外，DPS不需要四处奔跑或面对Boss。站在Boss后面不要动，跳舞不会给他留下深刻印象！





### 调查者加隆

> Investigator Garron


**调查者加隆**

这个Boss有些棘手，需要处理许多事情。作为一组，需要注意脚下的情况，并协调好自己的位置，不要像无头苍鹰一样四处奔跑，这对你没有任何帮助。他可以被嘲讽并施加debuff，但他会随意选择任何一个人进行攻击。站在一个阵型里，确保你们都离Boss很近，并保持治疗！

* **雾气** :  调查者加隆偶尔会聚集能量并释放一个雾气云在房间里。这将会追逐一个玩家，如果被追到会造成一定的持续伤害。只需在它周围做一个小圆圈，直到它消失即可避免它。不要跑向格拉思伍德！（是的，那是讽刺）一个小圆圈就够了。

* **上古卷轴Online游戏攻略

不安的灵魂** :  时不时，首领将会传送到房间的另一边，通常在他传送之前你会听到他的咏唱声。这时，他会在房间里召唤出一些幽灵。坦克应该将这些幽灵拉到首领身边，这样就能在攻击首领时进行AOE伤害。然而请注意，这些幽灵的攻击力相当的高。它们还会发动一种技能，可以被打断（所有玩家都要注意这点）。如果你没能打断这个技能，那么一个恶心的旋转冰块将会朝着怒气值最高的玩家飞去，对其造成高额伤害并将其定住。虽然你可以走出它的范围，但如果被困住依然会带来麻烦。

* **法球射击** :  有时加隆会施展一项技能并向他选择的目标射出单目标直接伤害的魔法球。这就是为什么你们要在各自的空间中保持距离。如果他瞄准了你，你有两个选择，格挡或闪避…两种都可以，但如果你不做任何一个，你将被击退很远并受到高伤害。一些输出或治疗可能无法幸存，所以要保持警惕！





### 鼠语者

> The Rat Whisperer


**鼠语者**

这个首领其实相当滑稽，一直在原地跳舞直到你触怒他。他有一些非常简单的机制，大部分都可以避免/控制，但如果你不注意，情况可能会很快变得非常混乱。 

其中一个机制是他会使用Teleport Strike，会将自己从一个地方瞬间传送到另一个地方，并对附近的玩家造成伤害。如果你站在他最初所在的地方，你会被传送到一个字母标记为“T”的位置上，这时候你需要往标记为“U”的位置移动，才能避免他的下一次攻击。 

他还会召唤一些由The Rat Whisperer控制的老鼠，这些老鼠只是制造混乱和分散注意力的手段，不过最好还是将它们击败。 

另外，他偶尔也会召唤一只Uulgarg the Hungry来攻击你。这只怪物很强壮，但攻击速度较慢，可以通过远离它，避免被它的攻击命中。 

总的来说，这个首领战并不复杂，只需要注意它的攻击方式和机制，就能顺利击败他。

* **鼠群攻击** :  当耗子哥大喊“我的小兵们，到我这里来”的时候，他会召唤一大群鼠群。它们的血量较低，单个攻击力并不强大，但如果坦克无法迅速控制它们，并且DPS不能快速地对它们施加AOE伤害，这些鼠群会不断叠加，并成为一个问题。不要惊慌。如果它们攻向你，最差的情况是格挡直到坦克掌控局面，但不要在房间里乱跑，跑动会让你不堪其忧，并会让坦克失去控制，追逐那些正在追你的东西。静止不动！

* **魔法炸弹** :  当Boss举起他的法杖时，他会召唤一个大型的魔法球，会降落在当前的仇恨目标（通常为坦克）处，接触地面时会爆炸。它会造成一些持续性的伤害，但对坦克的伤害不大，DPS和治疗应该要躲开它。然而，这个技能可以被打断，意味着你可以控制它，如果足够注意的话，你永远不用遭受它的攻击。

* **重击** :  这个技能也是持续施法的，同样可以被打断。他会向目标（坦克或仇恨目标）释放旋转的冰寒，如果击中DPS，可能会造成相当大的伤害，所以要小心，被影响的目标将被定身。打断它，这个机制就永远不会发生了。





### 饥饿的尤尔加格

> Uulgarg the Hungry


**饥饿的尤尔加格**

这个首领是大家都讨厌的首领之一。简单的机制会很快出错。首先，房间里面充满了敌人，应该仔细地把他们处理掉。然后首领应该被拉到楼梯下面。但是要小心，疯狂地在房间里乱跑会提早把首领引过来，这样你就不得不同时处理他和那些小怪。

* **恐慌** :  这个技能完全按照字面意思来使用。它会持续1秒后发出一声尖叫，使所有团队成员朝随机方向感到害怕。你必须在这场战斗中保持体力以应对这个技能。一旦他使你感到害怕，你必须迅速挣脱并重新回到原来的位置。位置是关键，尽可能将战斗保持在中心，否则情况会非常混乱。

* **重型攻击** :  并非总是在同一时间，有时是随机的，但通常当你被恐惧了（如果你没有及时打破）谁拥有仇恨（希望是坦克）他会追赶并发动一个非常大的重型攻击。如果被坦克或dps /治疗者格挡，你将存活下来并且完全没有承受太多伤害。但是如果你不阻挡它...你就会死亡。阻挡，不要逃跑！

* **旋风** :  在上述机制之间，他偶尔会使武器在其头部周围旋转，造成小范围持续物理伤害。这非常简单，迅速躲开即可...不要逃跑。





### 瓦莱尼·佩林加尔

> Varaine Pellingare


**瓦莱尼·佩林加尔**

这个BOSS既有趣又有些烦人。坦克应该始终将BOSS保持在中心位置，以防止他在伤害范围内进进出出，但由于他机制的随机性，这有些棘手。同时，需要保持意识，随时注意BOSS的机制。其中，The Rat Whisperer会在战斗中释放一些耗子，要及时将它们击杀；而Uulgarg the Hungry只有在玩家正在恢复生命值时才会变得可伤害。

* **重攻击** :  和所有的重攻击一样，这必须被格挡。不格挡会导致倒地和大量的伤害。所以要注意。坦克应该是唯一一个受到重攻击的人，但如果情况出了问题，你作为 DPS 也被攻击，只需格挡，不要逃跑。

* **爆发** :  首领偶尔会在地面上施放一个迅速扩散的AOE。如果你走出它的范围，你就不会受伤。如果没有走出它的范围，你将承受大量伤害并被击倒和眩晕。如果你真的幸存下来了，你就必须在眩晕后挣脱出来。坦克可以承受它，但其他人必须走出它的范围。此外，它会有一点延迟，这意味着它会在完全扩散之前就击中你，所以你必须快速离开它的范围。

* **span stylecolor yellow打击** :  这个首领偶尔会“随机”跳跃，旋转并施展一个非常大的锥形震荡物理攻击。你可以通过闪避翻滚、避开攻击或格挡来避免受到伤害，但你必须非常非常快速地反应。它会随机攻击它想攻击的人，并将击中的人击退/击倒。

伤害不算高但是会令人不爽，作为坦克如果你没有格挡，boss会移动到你被击倒的位置，离开小队的地面AOE。要让他保持静止，要思考迅速，并格挡或移动。其中，“坦克”指的是承受敌对攻击的前排角色，“AOE”即团队地面范围攻击技能。





### 亚琳·佩林加尔

> Allene Pellingare


**亚琳·佩林加尔**

《上古卷轴在线》中终极Boss在韦瑞斯下水道会令PUG灭团！如果你的坦克无法注意到重击，那么全团都会死亡。如果小组没有协调好并保持注意力，你们都会死亡。如果团员到处乱跑，那么你们也会死亡。她看似简单，但确实非常难搞。就像一位夜刃精灵，如果不注意保护，她可以秒杀任何人。

* **重击** :  这是一个简单的重击带有踢腿动作。如果你是DPS并阻挡它，这种攻击很有可能会让你死亡，不管你的装备多么好（除非你是魔力职业并有护盾）。如果你是坦克，她只会对你使用这招... 阻挡它。如果你不阻挡，不管你装备多么厚实，你也只能一击毙命！

* **旋** :  在她的重攻击后，她会进行非常快速的类似钢铁旋风般的旋转攻击。无论您是DPS、治疗师或者坦克，您都必须格挡这个攻击。它会造成大量的伤害，并且附近的团队成员也会受到范围攻击的影响。如果您的最大生命值不足，这很可能会杀死您。有两个选择，要么格挡，要么不要站得太靠近boss（总是站在背后而不是在前面）。

* **伏击** :  如同夜刃职业的惯例，她可以在你背后传送打击。这是随机的，可以打到任何人，受害者 必须 快速地格挡！然后小心，这次攻击后，她会对目标（通常是坦克）施加威胁性攻击，并有时会跟随另一次旋转攻击。如果你被伏击并没有格挡，然后被旋转攻击击中，就已经死亡。再次强调，不要乱跑...必须格挡。

* **蝙蝠** :  在整个战斗中，她会消失并召唤出4/5只吸血蝙蝠。使用AOE伤害杀死它们，让坦克控制它们，不要逃跑，这会打乱一切。当它们死亡时，她会重新生成，并瞄准坦克（或谁有仇恨），立即发动重击。

注意：她隐身时就开始蓄力这个重攻击了，因此请留意闪烁的火花式重攻击视觉效果。或者在蝙蝠死亡后直接按住格挡键也可以。

* **激怒** :  在剩余25%的生命值下，最终阶段，最后一次蝙蝠群袭击之后...她会变成黑色并带着红色的眼睛，攻击更强！机制完全相同（除了蝙蝠），然而偶尔她会使用类似灵魂束缚的攻击使团队眩晕。一定要快速打破这个束缚，否则她会跟进旋转和/或重击攻击。

> This boss is very simple with minimal mechanics. As you would expect from the first boss of a dungeon this is not particularly challenging HOWEVER there are still mechanics to follow and this one is MOSTLY all about the tank. Taunt the boss, tun it away from the group, and STAND STILL.
> 
> **Bite** - Very standard light attack type effect. This does a small amount of damage and the tank CAN block it but it isn't normally necessary. A chunk tank will be able to brush these attacks off, however a dps without a healer taking too many of these bites can cause a problem. This should only ever really be hitting the person with agro anyway (the tank) so the tank should constantly hold a taunt to save any issues.
> 
> **Tail Swipe** - This mechanic is very simple indeed. The boss will wind up a heavy attack and show a cone AOE visual. This is your time to block! IF you do not block you will be thrown across the room and the boss will then chase and follow up with a bite. Tanks can stand up to this easily but a dps or healer can take some large damage from it if not blocked. The key point to this is to hold the boss still (as the tank) and always block this mechanic. It is very simple of course but if you do NOT do this, the boss will run a bit wild, leave the floor dps abilities and people have to mess about scrambling to re-apply damage at a different location. Also the dps do NOT need to run around the room OR be in the bosses face. stay behind the boss and stand still, dancing doesn't impress him!

> 
> This boss is a little tricky with quite a lot going on. You need to watch your feet as a group, co-ordinate and don't run around the room like a headless chicken, it will NOT help. He can be taunted to apply the debuff BUT he will hit whoever he likes with his mechanics. Stand in a formation where you all have your own space close to the boss and keep those heals coming!
> 
> **Mist** - Garron will occasionally channel energy and release a mist cloud in the room. This will chase one player and if caught will do a decent amount of damage over time. Simply move in a small circle around it to avoid it until it has gone. DO NOT run to Grathwood! (yes that was sarcasm) A small circle is all you need.
> 
> **Restless Souls** - Every so often the boss will teleport across the room, usually just before he does you will hear him chant. When this happens he will spawn ghosts around the room. The tank should chain/pull these on top of the boss so that they can be damage down in AOE with the boss. HOWEVER keep in mind that these ghosts can hit quite hard. They channel an ability which CAN be interrupted (all players pay attention to these). If you fail to interrupt them, a nasty spinning ice effect will be thrown at the agroed player doing high damage and immobilizing them on the spot. You can walk out of its range but if caught it can cause problems.
> 
> **Orb/shot** - Occasionally Garron will channel a casting ability and fire a single target direct damage magic orb at his chosen target. THIS is why you stand away from each other in your own spaces. IF he aims at you, you have two choices, block or dodge roll...Either is fine but failure to do either will knock you back a LONG way and do high damage. Some dps and/healers wont survive this so be on your toes!

> ** THE RAT WHISPERER **
> 
> This boss is actually quite comical, dancing on the spot until you agro him. He has some very simple mechanics and most of which can actually be avoided/controlled BUT if you don't pay attention things can get messy fast.
> 
> **Skeever swarm** - When he shouts 'come to me my minions' he will summon a large group of skeevers. These have low health and don't individually hit too hard but if not controlled quickly by the tank and killed in aoe fast by the dps these can stack up and become a problem. Do not panic. If they are on you, worst case scenario BLOCK until the tank has control but do NOT run around the room, running will kill you in the back of the head and make it really tough for the tank to regain control chasing after the things that are chasing you. stand still!
> 
> **Magic bomb** - When he raises his staff he will summon a large magic orb which will land on whoever has agro (should be the tank) which explodes when it hits the ground. It does a small amount of tick damage over time but doesn't hit the tank too hard, dps and healers should step out of this. However his ability can be interrupted meaning it can be controlled and if paying enough attention, you never have to see it happen.
> 
> **Slam** - This ability is also channeled and can ALSO be interrupted. He will cast swirling ice at the target (tank or whoever has agro) this can hurt quite a bit if it hits a dps so be careful, and the target affected will be immobilized. Interrupt this and the mechanic will never happen.

> Uulgarg the Hungry

> 
> This boss is one of those bosses that everybody loves to hate. Simple mechanics that go wrong very fast. Firstly there is a room full of enemies that should be carefully dispatched in the middle of the room. THEN the boss should be pulled down the stairs. Be careful however, frantic running around the room will pull him early and you will have to deal with him and the adds at the same time.
> 
> **Fear** - This does exactly what it says on the tin. He will channel for 1 second and then shout causing ALL group members to be feared in a random direction. You MUST maintain your stamina for this fight for THIS mechanic. As soon as he fears you all you MUST break free and get back into position. Position is key, keep the fight as central as possible or else this will get messy FAST.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Not always at the same time, sometimes this is random, BUT usually while being feared (if you don't break fast enough) whoever has agro (hopefully the tank) he will chase down and wind up a very large heavy attack. If blocked by the tank or a dps/healer you will survive and be absolutely fine taking barely any damage. However if you do NOT block it...you are dead. BLOCK, do NOT run!
> 
> **Whirlwind** - Occasionally between the above mechanics he will spin his weapon around his head causing a small physical damage over time AOE. This is extremely simple, step out of it...do NOT run away.

> 
> This boss is quite fun and somewhat annoying. The tank should hold this boss in the center at all times to prevent him running in and out of damage but it is a little tricky due to the randomness of his mechanics.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - Like any heavy attack, this must be blocked. Not blocking will result in a knockdown and lots of damage taken. So pay attention. The tank should be the only one getting heavy attacked but if things go wrong and you are a dps being hit, just block. do NOT run.
> 
> **Burst** - Occasionally the boss will cast a fast growing AOE on the ground. If you step out of this, you will be fine. if not then you will take a LOT of damage and be knocked down and stunned. You will have to break free after the stun if you actually managed to survive it. A tank can take it but everyone else must get out of it. Also it has a bit of a delay on it meaning it will hit you before it has fully spread, so get out FAST.
> 
> **Strike** - Occasionally the boss 'randomly' jump, spin and cast a very large thin cone shaped shock wave type physical attack. This can be avoided with a dodge roll, stepping out of it OR a block BUT you must be very very fast to react. It will randomly hit whoever it feels like and knocks back /down whoever it hits.
> 
> The damage isn't high but it IS annoying and as a tank if you miss the block, the boss will move to your knocked down location taking him OUT of the group's ground based aoe..hold him still, think fast and block or move.

> The final boss in Wayrest Sewers is a PUG killer! If your tank cannot pay attention to heavy attacks, you are all going to die. If the group doesn't co-ordinate and pay attention, you will all die. IF people run around the room, you will all die. She is simple but one tough cookie. As you would expect from a nightblade, she can one shot anyone in the room if not paying attention.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is simple heavy attack with a kick. IF you are dps and you block this, chances are even though you blocked (unless you are magicka with a shield while blocking) you will either die or be close to death (her follow up attack WILL kill you). If you are the tank she SHOULD only be doing this to YOU...block it. if you do NOT block, you are dead in one shot no matter how chunky you are!
> 
> **Spin** - After her heavy attack she will do a very fast steel tornado type spin. Whether you are dps, healer or tank you MUST block this. It does a huge amount of damage and any close by members of the group will take an aoe hit form it. If you do not have max health this will most likely kill you. Two choices, block it, or don't stand so close to the boss (always stand behind not in front also).
> 
> **Ambush** - As you would expect from a nightblade, she can teleport strike you in the back. This is random, can hit anyone and the victim must be fast and BLOCK! then be careful, after this attack she will go to the agroed target(usually the tank) and sometimes followup with another spin attack. If you personally were ambushed and didn't block, then get hit with the spin after, you are dead. Again, do NOT run around...BLOCK.
> 
> **Bats** - Throughout the fight she will disappear and spawn 4/5 vampire bats. Kill these with AOE damage and control them with the tank, do NOT run away it messes everything up. As soon as they are dead she will re-spawn aiming at the tank (or whoever has agro) and instantly hit with a heavy attack.
> 
> NOTE: This heavy attack starts winding up while she is invisible so pay attention to the splashing spark type heavy attack visual. OR just hold block once the bats are dead.
> 
> **Enrage** - The final phase under 25% health, after the last bat swarm...she will go into a black form with red glowing eyes and start hitting harder! The mechanics are all exactly the same (minus the bats) as the rest of the fight however occasionally she will stun the group with a soul tether type attack. be sure to break this if you get stunned FAST, she follows up with a spin and/or heavy attack.
