## 恐霜要塞





### 冰冻的碎牙者

> Teethnasher the Frostbound


** 霜缚者 碎牙 **

该游戏攻略中提到的专有名词已完成翻译，攻略的标题为"TEETHNASHER THE FROSTBOUND"，翻译为"霜缚者 碎牙"。其中，是游戏中的图片，不需要翻译。**是一种html标签，表示字体颜色为黄色，也不需要翻译。

这个boss可能是整个地牢中最容易的boss。当然，大多数情况下第一个boss都比较容易，可以让你熟悉环境，但是在这个boss，特别是对于坦克来说，需要记住的主要事项是让他保持静止。没有必要奔跑。

* **冲锋** :  首领会朝着坦克或当前拥有仇恨的人发动冲锋攻击。这个攻击并不造成很大伤害，只需要简单格挡即可，不要在房间里到处乱跑，只需确保格挡即可。此外首领还有很多轻攻击，大部分坦克应该能够承受，但如果被攻击的是DPS/治疗角色，应该格挡而不是到处乱跑。

* **冰风** :  这个机制是持续存在的，非常简单，但是对于低等级的玩家（防御加成较低），您可能需要时不时地避开它。

基本上，这个BOSS周围不断有一个风暴AOE，每秒钟会造成冰属性伤害。同时也会施加减速效果。由于你应该保持BOSS不动，只需随时间将其击败，所以减速效果实际上没有作用，没有必要围绕房间奔跑。但是如果没有治疗者，受到的伤害会逐渐增多，所以你有两个选择。一是站在AOE中，在治疗者不受影响的情况下造成伤害，使大家都能存活下来。或者简单地造成伤害后，走出AOE区域，等待回复体力再重新进入。任何一种方式都可以，受到的伤害实际上并不太严重，如果坦克能够保持BOSS不动，你可以有足够的时间走出AOE并进行治疗。





### 烈焰守护者

> Guardian of the Flame


这是一段攻略，标题为“火焰守护者”，其中包含了一些专有名词，请参考以下翻译：

** 火焰守护者 **

如果坦克能将boss稳定住，并且团队能够不乱跑，这个boss非常简单。你越是乱跑，战斗就会变得越困难。因此，请找到你的位置并保持不动，除非机制要求你移动。如果你必须移动，请尽快回到你的位置！如果你知道如何避免移动并保持稳定，这个战斗应该会很容易应对。

* **重击** :  这个技能非常简单，就是一个长时间的重击，必须格挡否则你会被打倒并摔到地上。坦克应该注意这个技能并一直格挡它。如果boss正在攻击DPS或治疗角色，同样的规则也适用，格挡技能。

* **冲锋** :  位置关键！不要在房间里乱跑，因为BOSS会冲着最远目标冲锋并释放一个讨厌的前置AOE效果。他会在战斗中随机这样做，但通常是因为人们太远了。如果发生这种情况，重新评估你的小组位置并停止逃跑！如果你被冲锋了，可以格挡，所以在这种情况下，要格挡。乱跑只会让你死。

* **攻略翻译如下

龙息攻击** :  几乎每隔一段时间，Boss 会对拥有仇恨的人（应该是坦克）释放一次龙息攻击。这是一个锥形范围攻击，如果可能的话，应该尽量格挡。坦克不会受到太多伤害，但其他人可能会受到相当大的伤害，所以如果它朝向了一名 DPS / 治疗人员，他们应该躲闪或格挡。不要在房间里四处跑动。这也会让目标有些打退，有点麻烦。如果你是DPS / 治疗人员，一直站在Boss背后，这不会成为一个问题。

* **闪电飞溅** :  BOSS偶尔会瞄准一个随机目标（因此需要有自己的专门位置，以便知道他的目标），然后会在他所选定目标的脚下放置一个恶心的aoe。简单记下他瞄准的目标，然后该目标应该离开aoe并避免受到伤害，同时回到适当的位置。你必须尽快回到战斗中，以防止由于距离过远而发动的冲锋攻击。基本上，脱离危险后，再重新进入战斗。如果你不是坦克，请不要在aoe中停留超过一两秒，否则会受到很大的伤害。





### 德萝达的恐怖领主

> Drodda's Dreadlord


**德萝达的恐怖领主**

这个BOSS很简单，但是如果人们不注意的话可能会让团灭。坦克应该待在房间中央与BOSS并肩作战，并留意到进攻的小怪。其余的团队成员应该保持相对接近，并注意小怪。。小怪造成的伤害很高！

* **重击** :  这是一个简单的重击。它总是瞄准拥有仇恨的人，这通常应该是坦克，然而如果它瞄准了一个 DPS/治疗，同样的规则也适用……格挡！不要逃跑！受攻击的人应该不断地防御。

* **劈砍** :  他偶尔会将武器转动在头上，在自身周围发出一个小范围的伤害效果。这会造成持续伤害，脆皮角色应该避免，但坦克角色应该可以承受住。再次强调不要逃跑，只需踏出攻击范围，就可以安全地避免受到伤害。

注意：在德萝达被打败后不要忘记按下房间里的按钮，以降低通往下一场战斗的吊桥。

* **爆炸性班肯魔法兽** :  战斗开局以及战斗周期性地，首领会召唤爆炸性班肯魔法兽。它们的生命值并不高，因此如果地面上有很多AOE伤害，它们在召唤时可以死亡。但请注意，如果它们靠近DPS/治疗师，它们几乎可以并且有时候会一击杀死玩家。如果有多个魔法兽同时爆炸，那肯定会死亡。坦克可以抵挡住这些爆炸，但其他人则不能。当这些魔法兽被召唤时，坦克应该尽快用链子或控制技能让它们不要朝向团队跑去。如果你是DPS/治疗师并且遇到麻烦，你可以打滚来避开它们的爆炸，但不要在房间里跑来跑去。





### 德萝达的学徒

> Drodda's Apprentice


**德萝达的学徒**

这个首领将为你准备打败最后的首领。一开始会有很多小兵，所以确保你的坦克在抓住首领的同时尽快抓住他们并保持首领静止。在首领后部（每个人都有自己的区域）周围设置一个阵型，与团队一起远离首领的脸。密切注意他的机制，不要逃走！

* **重击** :  有时候，Boss会进行重击，瞄准坦克（或谁拥有团队仇恨）。简单地格挡就可以避免受到伤害，但如果不能格挡，你将被打倒，而其他机制的连锁反应可能会给你带来麻烦。注意，如果你被扔到地上，你将变得更容易受到其他攻击。

* **攻略翻译

冰霜爆炸** :  当你注意到从Boss下方开始扩散的AOE效果时，请小心！一旦这个机制开始发生，请尽快离开它消耗/扩散的区域，因为它会造成极强的打击并施加击倒效果。这个机制对于最后一个Boss非常重要，要尽快适应。

“Boss将会选定一个目标并将吸取效果束缚于这个目标身上（随机选择），并且持续越久，Boss会回复更多生命值。你必须要从束缚状态中挣脱出来！这对于最后的Boss也是非常重要的注意点。”

* **Blast** :  这位Boss定期会尝试引导一个施放时间的技能，该技能会对随机目标造成范围伤害。这可以被打断，所以要仔细注意，就没什么问题了。但是如果它开始释放，请在它着陆之前离开该区域。





### 寒冰之心

> Iceheart


**冰心**

这个首领其实很简单，遵循着大多数标准的寒冰元素的规则，只有一点点区别（几个额外的机制）。坦克应该把首领放在一定位置，并将其背对团队。团队应该一直留在首领的背后，这样就可以避免受到他最有效的攻击造成的伤害。

* **锥形范围伤害** :  这个锥形范围伤害技能始终瞄准仇恨目标的方向。这个目标应该是坦克。只需盾牌格挡，你就能承受极小的伤害，然而如果你是输出/治疗职业且技能瞄准到你身上（这是不应该的）只需盾牌格挡或者走开。请记住如果你不是坦克，不要站在boss面前。

* **冰爆** :  注意来自BOSS底部的扩散AOE效果！当这个机制开始发生时，尽快离开它正在消耗/扩散的区域，等它消失后再重新进入。它类似于最后的BOSS，会击退/晕眩并造成适中的伤害。注意躲避。

* **重击** :  首领将用拳头猛击地面，每个玩家的周围将出现一个小的范围伤害圆圈，圆圈将会爆炸并从地面冒出一大块冰柱，从冰柱中将会冒出尸鬼类型的敌人。它们的生命值非常低，很容易快速击杀，但如果可能，坦克应该抓住它们并/或将它们固定在原地，以免它们四处乱窜。作为输出和治疗，不要逃跑，否则它们将会追逐你并从你的背后杀死你。不要惊慌！





### 冰境的德萝达

> Drodda of Icereach


** 冰境的德萝达 **

在Direfrost中的最终boss是每个组队玩家的噩梦！

这个首领的机制非常简单，但如果人们不注意，情况就会迅速恶化。这场战斗的关键点是确保你不像无头苍蝇一样四处奔波，所有人都找到自己的领地，并保留你的耐力，你需要它。在房间里飞奔会让你死亡和/或使这场战斗变得非常困难！这个首领可以被debuff，但不能嘲讽，她会攻击她喜欢的人，所以坦克应该保持debuff，吸引小怪，并在小组上保持盾牌（如果他们有的话）。对于这场战斗，坦克处于“保护模式”。

* **轻攻击** :  Boss会在她喜欢的时间攻击谁，这就是为什么你们所有人都要找到自己的位置，以确保你们知道她瞄准的目标是谁。如果堆在一起，这将是无法判断的。她会对她选择的目标发射冰霜轻攻击，通常是连续3次。这些攻击会很痛！如果你是目标，请使用盾牌和格挡（如果是魔法）或者格挡/闪避翻滚（如果是体力），如果你有足够的体力。治疗师应该关注目标并保持他们的生命值，因为如果没有治疗，连续两次这样的攻击就会杀死你。

* **传送和冰爆** :  当她传送（定期）时，她会出现在不同的位置。迅速寻找她并确定她的位置。她着陆时会从她的身下释放一个非常大的范围伤害技能，并且一旦技能达到峰值，冰针就会从地面上爆裂出来。如果这个技能击中了一个DPS/治疗角色，他们就会瞬间死亡。（除非他们有非常高的抗性）在任何情况下都要避免这个技能，然后再回到原来的位置。

* **冰龙虫** :  当血量降至50%以下时，她会不时召唤2只冰龙虫。它们的轻攻击具有毒性，可以使用一个冲锋技能将玩家撞倒。这些怪物很容易被发现，应该避免或者格挡它们的攻击，但最重要的是坦克的作用。坦克需要保护整个团队，嘲讽这两只怪物并将它们攻击BOSS。使用AOE技能就可以快速消灭它们。请记住，不要跑来跑去，放松心态并保持队形，以便看到来自BOSS的攻击。

* **冰元素** :  当首领血量低于25%时会召唤两只冰元素。它们会从地面冒出尖刺攻击，还会进行锥形攻击。坦克需要像对待天魂一样将它们堆在首领身上，以便使用AOE技能消灭它们。如果它们攻击了你，你作为DPS/治疗职业，就躲闪攻击并不要惊慌失措。让坦克控制它们，不要四处乱跑。由于它们的血量很低，所以不会持续太久。

“抽干！”，这是决定这个地下城成败的关键！

和德萝达的学徒一样，她会定期攻击一个玩家……她会将光束附着在目标身上，每秒钟将吸取他们的生命值并回复自己的生命值。她回复的很多！！！一些小组发现根据她每秒钟回复的生命值来看，几乎不可能杀死她，所以这个机制的关键是你必须“解放自己！”如果你没有足够的耐力来做到这一点，那你就麻烦了！

当光束照在你身上时，立即打破控制！这就是为什么你必须在整个战斗中保留你的耐力。这个机制是最大的问题。保持队形，这样你可以看到她瞄准的目标并尽快处理问题！整个地牢中最简单的机制，但可能会让整个小组完全崩溃。祝你好运！

> This boss is quite possibly the easiest boss in the dungeon. Of course most of the time the first one is the easiest to get you into the swing of things but the main thing to remember with this boss especially as the tank is to keep him STILL. There is no need to run at all.
> 
> **Charge** - The boss with hit with a charge attack in the direction of the tank or whoever has agro at the time. This does NOT do a lot of damage and a simple block will be enough, do not run around the room, just be sure to block it and you will be fine. Also he has a lot of light attacks which most tanks should be able to stand up to but if a dps/healer is attacked you should BLOCK not run around the room.
> 
> **Ice wind** - This mechanic is ongoing and is very simple however with players of lower champion points (lower resist bonuses) you may want to avoid it from time to time.
> 
> Basically the boss has a constant wind aoe surrounding it which ticks with ice damage every second. This also applies a snare affect. Since you should keep this boss very still and just kill him over time the snare is ineffective really, there is NO need to run around the room. However the damage if you do not have a healer will mount up so you have two options. Stand in it and do your damage as a dps while the healer stays out of it and helps you all survive. OR simple do your damage, step out of it and recover and then go back in again. Either method works fine, the damage is really not so bad and if you do dip in health there is plenty of time to get out of the aoe and heal up so long as the tank holds it still!

> 
> This boss is very simple IF the tank holds him still and the group are capable of NOT running around the room. The more you run the more difficult the fight gets. So find your positions and stay there unless the mechanics require you to move. If you have to move, get back into position ASAP!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - his is as simple as it gets, a long swing into a heavy attack which MUST be blocked else you will be knocked down and across the floor. The tank should look out for this and always block it. If the boss is on a dps/healer, same rule applies, block it.
> 
> **Charge** - Position is KEY! Do NOT run around the room, because if you do the target furthest will be charged by the boss and then hit with a nasty frontal aoe effect. He will randomly do this sometimes throughout the fight but generally it is due to people being too far away. If this is happening, reevaluate your groups position and stop running away! If you are being charged you CAN block it, so in the event of this happening, do so. Running around will just get you killed.
> 
> **Breath** - Every so often he cast a breath attack on the person who has agro (should be the tank). This is a cone shaped affect and should be blocked if possible. The tank wont take too much damage but anyone else can take quite a bit so if it is facing a dps/healer they should either dodge roll from it or simply block. Do NOT run around the room. This also staggers the target a bit so is a little annoying. Keep behind the boss at all times if you are a dps/healer and this wont be a problem.
> 
> **Lightning splash** - The boss will occasionally aim at a random target (so have your own dedicated positions so you know who he is targeting) and he will place a nasty aoe on the ground under the feet of his chosen target. Simple note WHO he is aiming at and then the target should move out of the aoe and avoid the damage while getting back into a suitable position. The reason you MUST get back into the fight asap is to prevent the charge attack due to being too far away. Basically get out of the trouble and then get  back into the fight again. Standing in the aoe WILL hurt a lot so don't stay in it for more than a second or two if you are not the tank.

> 
> This boss is simple but can cause wipes if people are not paying attention. The tank should stay with the boss in the middle of the room and hold him still and watch for incoming banekins. The rest of the group should stay fairly close and watch for banekins also..they do hurt!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is a simple heavy attack. It is always aimed at the person who has agro and this should always be the tank however if it is on a dps/healer the same rules apply...BLOCK! do NOT run away!
> 
> **Cleave** - He will occasionally spin his weapon around his head emitting a small aoe around himself. This does damage over time and should be avoided by the squishies but the tank should be fine with it. Again do NOT run away, just step out of it and you will be fine.
> 
> NOTE: after she is dead don't forget to press the button in the room to lower the drawbridge to the next fight.
> 
> **Exploding Banekins** - At the start of the fight and during the fight periodically the boss will spawn exploding banekin adds, these do not have much health so if there is a lot of aoe damage down on the floor they CAN die when they spawn but be warned if they get CLOSE to a dps/healer they can almost and sometimes completely one shot a player. More than one blowing up at once is for sure certain death. The tank can with stand it but others cannot. When these spawn the tank should try to chain/pin them as soon as possible to prevent them running at the group. If you are a dps/healer and you ARE in trouble you can dodge roll to avoid them while they explode but don't run around the room if you can help it.

> This boss is what will prepare you for the last boss. There are lots of adds to start with so be sure your tank grabs them as fast as possible on top of the boss while holding the boss still. Setup a formation surrounding the boss (everyone has their own space) around the back of the boss away from the bosses face with the rest of the group. Pay CLOSE attention to his mechanics and do NOT run away!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Occasionally the boss will heavy attack the tank (or whoever has agro) simple block this and you will be fine but if not you WILL be knocked down and the domino affect of other mechanics hitting you while you are down can be a mess.
> 
> **Ice blast** - Watch for the spreading aoe effect that comes from underneath the boss! When this mechanic starts happening, get out of the area it is consuming/spreading too as soon as possible, it will hit really hard and apply a knock down. This mechanic is VERY important to get used to for the last boss.
> 
> **Drain** - The boss will pick a target to attach a draining affect beam to a chosen target (random) and the longer he holds the target in the air the more health he will gain back, you MUST break free from this! This is also very important to pay attention to for the last boss.
> 
> **Blast** - The boss periodically attempt to channel a cast timed ability which will launch a nasty blast in aoe of affect at a random target. This can be interrupted so pay close attention to this and it wont ever be a problem. However if it is cast, just move out of the way before it lands.

> Iceheart

> ** ICEHEART **
> 
> This boss is actually pretty simple and follows very similar rules to most standard Ice Atronahcs with a little bit of a twist (couple of extra mechanics) The tank should position the boss on the spot and turn it away from the group. The group should always stay behind the boss and this will prevent them from taking damage from his most effective attacks.
> 
> **Cone aoe** - This cone shaped affect aoe ability is always aimed in the direction of the person who has agro. This should be the tank. Simply block this and you will take minimal damage, however if you are a dps/healer and this is aiming at you (which it shouldn't be) simply block or step out of it. Remember you should NOT be in front of the boss if you are not the tank.
> 
> **Ice blast** - Watch for the spreading aoe effect that comes from underneath the boss! When this mechanic starts happening, get out of the area it is consuming/spreading too as soon as possible and once it is gone get back in again. It is similar to the last boss,  adds a knock back/stagger and does moderate damage.
> 
> **Slam** - The boss will smash the ground with his fist and a small aoe damage circle will appear under each player, after it bursts a large frost spike will come out of the ground and out of the spikes will spawn Draugr type enemies. They have very low health and are easy to kill quickly but if possible the tank should grab hold of them and/or pin them so they don't run wild. As dps and healers do NOT run away, they will just chase you and kill you in the back of the head. DON'T panic!

> The final boss in Direfrost is every pick up group's NIGHTMARE!
> 
> The boss has very simple mechanics but it can go so wrong so fast if people don't pay attention. Key points for this fight are to make sure you do not run around like a headless chicken, all find your own space and preserve your stamina, you WILL need it. Sprinting around the room will kill you and/or make this fight REALLY hard!. This boss can be debuffed but NOT taunted, she will hit who she likes, so the tank should keep up debuffs, grab adds and keep shields(if they have any) on the group. The tank is 'protect mode' for this fight.
> 
> **Light Attacks** - The boss will hit who she likes when she likes, this is why you all find your own positions to make sure you know WHO she is aiming at. Stacking up will make this impossible to tell. She will fire off frost light attacks at her chosen target, usually x3 in a row. These HURT! If you are the target, shield and block (if magicka) or block/dodge roll if you are stamina and you can afford the stamina to do so. The healer should focus the target and keep them up as 2 of these in a row without a heal WILL kill you.
> 
> **Teleport and ice blast** - When she teleports(periodically) she will spawn at a different location. Look for her fast and gauge where she is. The second she lands she will emit a very large aoe from under her and once it is at peak it will burst with ice shards from the ground. IF this hits a dps/healer, they are dead. One shot! (unless they have stupid high resists) avoid this at all costs and THEN get back into position.
> 
> **Ice Wraiths** - At 50% and under she will spawn ice wraiths (x2) every so often, these have nasty light attacks and can use a charge ability which will knock down players, these are easy to spot and should be avoided or blocked but above all this is where the tank comes in. While protecting the group, taunt these 2 and stick them on the boss. Aoe damage alone should be able to dispatch these fast. Remember do NOT run around the room, relax and keep up a formation so you can see the incoming attacks from the boss.
> 
> **Ice Atronachs** - Under 25% she will spawn 2x frost atronachs. They spawn spikes from the ground which should be avoided and they also attack with frontal cone attacks. The tank should treat these just like the wraiths and stack them on the boss so they can be killed with aoe. If they are on you and you are a dps/healer, just block and don't panic. Let the tank grab control of them and DON'T run around the room. They have low health so will not last long.
> 
> **Drain!**- This is what makes or breaks this dungeon!
> 
> Just like Drodda's Apprentice she will target one player periodically...she will attach a beam to the target and every second will drain their health and heal herself. She heals a LOT!!! some groups find it almost impossible to kill her based on how much she heals per second so the KEY point to this mechanic is you MUST 'BREAK FREE!'. If you do not have enough stamina to do so you are in trouble!
> 
> When the beam is on you, break free instantly! This is why you must preserve your stamina throughout the fight. This mechanic alone is the biggest problem. Stay in your formation so you can see who she is aiming at and deal with this problem as soon as possible! The most simple mechanic in the entire dungeon that can completely wreck a group. Have fun!
