### 奴隶主夏尔-努尔

> XAL-NUR THE SLAVER


* **奴隶主夏尔** : 努尔 **

这个首领需要团队协调和集中注意力。坦克应该尽可能将首领靠近房间中心，以防止团队跑得太远（接下来会有）。虽然他的攻击并不特别强大，但是有一些机制可能会迅速压倒整个团队。

* **Roar** :  这个BOSS会时不时地咆哮，周围会有一个相当大的范围效果，可以造成高额的持续伤害和小型打断/击退效果。除非你是坦克，否则不要故意站在里面。

* **冲锋** :  BOSS会随机选一个人进行冲锋。从技术上讲，这看起来像是一次重击（白色火花效果）。被选中的目标应该格挡，以免被他撞过去，但是...如果小组足够快，一旦他开始奔跑（注意他必须已经开始移动，之前的吟颂不算），你就可以打断它。这需要练习，但是通过时机的把握，这个机制就非常容易应对了。

* **弓箭手** :  在战斗中，弓箭手将会加入房间，他们会进行令人讨厌的远程攻击和“瞄准”能力，可以一击杀死DPS。如果他们开始施展“瞄准”，必须击败他们。

* **巨魔** :  除了弓箭手外，每个阶段房间里都会有一个巨魔。这些巨魔必须由坦克控制，并尽可能快地击杀（集中攻击小怪而不是BOSS，因为BOSS本身有生命值计时器）。他们会造成高额伤害并经常对地面造成伤害范围。如果你能击败它们，就不要留它们活着。

* **跺脚** :  与漩涡竞技场里的巨兽完全相同，首领偶尔会跺脚，房间周围的石头会沿着地面发射，如果被击中将会造成中等伤害和中断/小击退。

* **瓦马苏奴隶贩子** :  战斗中，首领会变得免疫所有伤害。这会根据他的最大生命值发生3次，生命值越低次数越多（尽管如果你的伤害很高，这些可以重叠并有时甚至跳过最后一个阶段）。在这些阶段，巨魔会进入房间，需要杀死一个奴隶贩子，让他们释放他们的瓦马苏来帮助你四处杀死小怪。确保你的小组指定一个成员在每个免疫阶段仅释放一次瓦马苏。

* **吐口水泥蟹** :  在免疫阶段，首领会在地上吐口水。不要站在上面。看看房间周围，有两个角落需要关注。其中一个会有一股喷水的天然气柱，那个方向是你需要朝向的。

因此，确定目标/方向后，小组中的一名成员（不是坦克）需要穿过口水，直接走到间歇泉。你拿到的口水持续时间越长，你移动的速度就会越慢，你没有资源，你会因为小怪的攻击而受到伤害，你会被螃蟹追赶，而且boss在这个阶段也可以选择向你冲锋。其中，"spit"翻译为口水，"geyser"翻译为间歇泉，"tank"翻译为坦克，"goo"翻译为口水，"adds"翻译为小怪，"mudcrabs"翻译为螃蟹。

尽可能靠近间歇泉，然后扔下它。让另一个队员接过它并完成任务。如果有人在途中为您治疗会很有帮助，因为大多数人在途中都会死亡。一旦间歇泉被堵住，BOSS将会进入咆哮机制，这时他又能够承受伤害了。

如上所述，在战斗期间将出现三次此情况。在这些时候，你必须让你的坦克抓住尽可能多的小兵却不放下BOSS。当他不再免疫后，使用终极技能有助于推动他进入下一阶段并快速处理小兵。但选择权在你手中。

注意：如上所述，这个BOSS的机制是基于它的血量的。所以你越快地烧掉它，越可能出现多个同时发生的机制，导致重叠。所以为了保险起见，慢慢来！集中攻击添加物并清空房间，然后再集中攻击BOSS。反复重复这个过程！





### 扎茨

> ZATZU


**扎茨**

这个boss几乎可以算是一个“燃烧节日”，它并不难，但是有一些非常重要的基本机制，这将有助于你在剩余的地下城中处理如石雕师的怪物。让你的坦克尽可能地稳住boss，同时将它背对着队伍。然而，这个boss的关键点是，围着它转圈毫无用处。所以要集中注意力，稳住脚步，并在必要时移动，而不是只因为你认为这看起来很酷（剧透：其实不是）。

* **重击** :  首领有一个升天击攻击，他会攻击具有仇恨值（应该是坦克）的人，必须格挡，否则你会被击倒。

* **瞬间传送重击** :  BOSS将举起手，跳入空中！ 然后他会着陆在拥有仇恨的目标上。 有一个巨大的AOE溅泼。你需要避开这个并远离它，但是当他着陆时，地面上也会有石头飞过，超出AOE范围。即使你不在AOE范围内，请确保他着陆时进行格挡。

* **飞石攻击** :  在战斗中，首领将停止攻击并开始咏唱技能。这将会使空中出现石头并一遍又一遍地攻击团队，直到咏唱结束为止。在这个阶段，您必须格挡，否则会被击倒。这些攻击造成适度的伤害，但如果您被打倒时还有另一个攻击击中了您（反应过慢），您可能会死亡。这与Aetherian Archive的第二个首领在75%及以下阶段完全相同。





### Ruins of Mazzatun的中文翻译为“麻扎通废墟”。其中，Mazzatun为游戏中的一个地方名词，没有明确的中文对应，因此保留原名。

> THE MIGHTY CHUDAN


* **这是一段游戏攻略介绍了游戏 Elder Scrolls Online 的一个Boss（头目）** :  THE MIGHTY CHUDAN（强大的楚丹）。其中出现了一些专有名词的英文原词：

- Uppercut=>升天击
- Zatzu=>扎茨
- Tree-Minder=>树之牧者
- Za=>扎
- Slave=>奴隶
- Slaver=>奴隶贩子
- Roar=>咆哮
- Xal-Nur the Slaver=>奴隶主夏尔-努尔
- Tree-Minder Na-Kesh=>树之牧者纳-凯石
- Dive=>下潜
- Tun=>图恩
- Un=>乌恩
- Spirit=>灵魂

注意，本题要求不翻译出现在 <> 符号内的 HTML 标签，因此这里不需要翻译 ``，可以直接翻译的部分是：

THE MIGHTY CHUDAN -> 强大的楚丹
** -> 黄色字体
** -> 结束黄色字体的标记

这个BOSS的机制非常简单，只要按照要求去做就可以了，但是很多人认为他们需要围着BOSS跑来保持安全...错误的。这个房间非常大，所以你跑得越多，就越难控制人的安全和情况。坦克需要将BOSS嘲讽并把它一直转向远离团队的方向。BOSS的打击范围可能有些棘手，所以DPS可能需要突出/选中BOSS的目标。

* **喷吐（重击机制）** :  在战斗中，Chudan会发起一次重击。这不同于普通的攻击。你需要尽可能地格挡大部分伤害，但是她会向目标（应该是坦克）连续喷吐数次，造成巨大的伤害并在地上留下AOE。每个人都必须远离AOE，坦克不能让首领转动。

注：如果你是一名有翅膀的龙骑士或坦克，并且有防御姿态或法术墙，这将使吐息反弹回BOSS...这需要时机。你也可以进行一定程度的闪避，但再次需要时机。最重要的是，请确保格挡它，治疗师需要专注于你。

注意：如果你是一个输出职业，如果这个技能打在你身上，你需要连续翻滚三次，每次间隔一秒钟（这会消耗你的资源），否则你就会死亡......基本上对于坦克来说......不要放掉BOSS！！

* **Haj** : mota adds” - 战斗期间将会出现2只一组的哈吉摩塔增援。它们比地牢中的普通怪物小，但如果你能把它们清除掉，那会有所帮助，否则当它们开始向小组进行下潜时，你很快就会被压倒！

* **弓箭手** :  在战斗中，房间内会有远距离的弓箭手。如果坦克能够管理好，最好让这些弓箭手被锁定在Boss上（小心不要让Boss旋转）。它们会不断刷新，如果你不能快速击杀它们，它们会压倒整个团队！

* **闪电盾** :  在战斗中，有一个阿尔戈尼安人身上有个巨大的闪电盾。玩家无法攻击这个目标，但它还活着的时候会不断用闪电攻击来打击整个小组...更多信息见下文。

* **冲锋** :  这个Boss会选择一个随机玩家，然后一个大的快速扩散的范围技能会在他们的脚下出现并开始扩散...不要试图逃跑，因为它针对的就是你！记得上面的那个闪电人吗？好了，这就是你阻止他的方式。把那个范围技能带到他面前站着。

* **一旦群体攻击达到峰值Chudan将向你进行大规模的地下潜行在它接近你之前你需要躲闪翻滚Chudan将直接经过并摧毁闪电人和他的盾牌从此以后就是反复洗涤直到再次发生新的haj** : motas，新的射手等等。其中可能会有Uppercut、Zatzu、Tree-Minder这些专有名词，直接翻译即可。





### 树之牧者纳-凯石

> TREE-MINDER NA-KESH


* **树之牧者纳** : 凯石 **

这个BOSS让每个P.U.G都变成恶梦，因为通常会出现'疲惫执行'现象。基本上，我是说，人们看着BOSS的血量，就假设它快死了，所以忽略了所有机制...这会让你在这里死亡。你必须始终关注机制，尤其是在执行阶段。让你的坦克像对待其他BOSS一样保持BOSS静止并嘲讽，DPS在她后面形成半圆形。然后准备集中精力应对接下来发生的任何事情。这需要一个自信或至少称职的坦克！

* **重击** :  这个很容易辨认，双持武器的重击！看到它蓄势，就格挡它！不管你是不是坦克，这个攻击都会有很大的击退效果，但如果你格挡了，伤害会减少很多。

* **图腾** :  在战斗中，首领将从地面生成一个图腾。当出现图腾时，坦克需要尽可能地对其施加减益（碎甲），并将首领堆叠在其上。团队需要尽快全力攻击它。在它的寿命期内，它将在很短的时间内耗尽玩家的所有资源，直到什么都没有剩下，然后将你保持在0。这个必须被击败，在每个阶段都会出现一个。（除非你使用高伤害跳过了阶段）。开始战斗为第一阶段。

* **灵魂阶段** :  当血量下降到70%和50%时，她会躲进笼子里并对所有攻击免疫，同时召唤之前BOSS的灵魂来攻击你。首先是在70%时出现Chudan的灵魂。务必确保你的坦克清醒，因为她会释放致命攻击，如果坦克没有快速嘲讽，你就会失去一个玩家。在这个阶段，你可以快速击败灵魂，然后继续攻打BOSS，或者你可以慢慢打，积攒大招。这是你自己的选择。一旦BOSS死亡，她会离开笼子，战斗继续。当血量下降到50%时，这种情况会再次发生，但这次你将再次与奴隶主夏尔-努尔战斗。

* **小怪** :  如果你的伤害不高，在她血量降到70%时会出现小怪，但是如果你成功避免了它们在这个时候出现，它们在她血量降到70%和50%时她出笼后将会出现。

这些小怪包括近战和远程压缩单位，还有其中最恶心的一个“石匠”。记住这些家伙的机制。必须集中攻击，如果有岩石在空中，必须格挡！

坦克应该尽可能抓住尽可能多的小怪，包括石制品塑造者（实际上他更重要），并将它们与BOSS聚集在一起并定身。不要让小怪跑到琥珀质浆池中充能。

当小怪出现时，你很可能会得到一个图腾。所以如果这种情况发生，让所有人包括BOSS一起堆叠在图腾上，小组需要尽快将其消灭，否则你很可能会团灭。你需要大量的AOE技能，所以在小怪在房间里的时候要保持你的点状攻击技能。如果你吸引了任何小怪的仇恨，并且你不是坦克，请不要逃跑。如果你在跑圈，你一定会被敌人追上，你一定会搞砸一切，你会死的...专注！

* **雕像** :  当首领幽灵被击败并被释放时(达到70%/50%)，她会咒骂小组中的<b>一个成员</b>，该成员的屏幕会显示一些奇怪的梦幻般的颜色，他们所有技能都会变成相同的技能（没有治愈、伤害和增益，只有一种简单的技能）。小组可以看到房间中亮起的哪个雕像。因此，受诅咒者需要让小组知道他们被诅咒了，小组应该一起移动到正确的雕像旁边，这样受诅咒者才能攻击到正确的雕像，打破雕像将移除诅咒。这需要严密的协调。你可以通过集体配合来为队友揭示正确的雕像，但是一起攻击首领和小怪更加安全。当首领进入狂暴状态（30%以下）时，这个阶段也会发生，所以你必须集中精力。

这个机制将在灵魂被打倒后的70%、50%、30%及以下时各发生一次，这总共会发生3次。

特别提示：只要坦克对首领使用了嘲讽技能，她就不会对坦克施加诅咒。因此，在她离开笼子之前务必使用嘲讽技能，否则情况会迅速恶化。其中"taunt"为嘲讽技能，"boss"为首领，"curse"为诅咒。

* **执行** :  最后阶段我称之为“执行恐慌”，因为人们看到闪烁的光就开始疯狂跳跃，但是不要这样做。当Boss生命值降至30%以下时，它会进入狂暴模式，并释放类似闪烁光线的旋转AOE效果，会向玩家射出根系造成伤害并减速。你可以在间隙中稍微微动来躲避攻击，但是因为过多的事情在发生，只专注于自己的工作更为安全。

时刻保持她的嘲讽，继续治疗并保持输出和技能轮换，比看起来要轻松得多。其中"taunted"指的是嘲讽技能，"heals"指的是治疗术，"damage"指的是伤害输出，"rotations"指的是技能轮换。

* **这篇攻略为Elder Scrolls Online游戏提供帮助游戏中有许多专有名词例如升天击（Uppercut）、扎茨（Zatzu）、树之牧者（Tree** : Minder）等等。其中奴隶（Slave）和奴隶贩子（Slaver）也是游戏中的重要角色。其他名词包括咆哮（Roar）、奴隶主夏尔-努尔（Xal-Nur the Slaver）、树之牧者纳-凯石（Tree-Minder Na-Kesh）、下潜（Dive）、图恩（Tun）、乌恩（Un）、灵魂（Spirit）等。

杀死并控制所有的小怪。

无论如何都要消灭图腾。

清除最后的诅咒。

如果你按照以上方法，放松心态，不要围着转圈，团结合作，执行起来很容易。但是，如果你开始惊慌失措地在房间里乱跑，就完了。不管需要多长时间，你都必须专注于最后一阶段。环绕伤害效果“看起来很吓人”，但实际上没有看上去那么糟糕。

> XAL-NUR THE SLAVER
> 
> 
> ** XAL-NUR THE SLAVER **
> 
> This boss is all about co-ordination and focus as a group. The tank should hold the boss as close to the middle of the room as possible to prevent any long runs for the group(coming up). He doesn't hit particularly hard but there are some mechanics which can overwhelm the group quickly.
> 
> **Roar** - The boss will roar occasionally with a fairly large aoe around him, this does tiny interrupt/knock backs while doing high damage over time. Do not stand in this intentionally unless you are the tank.
> 
> **Charge** - he boss will pick one person at random to charge at. Now this TECHNICALLY is and looks like a heavy attack (white sparks). The target chosen should block so they don't get run over by him BUT...if the group is fast enough, as soon as he starts running (note he must have started moving, the channeling before doesn't count) you CAN interrupt it. This will take practice, but timing makes this mechanic very easy.
> 
> **Archers** - During the fight archers will be added to the room, they will do nasty long ranged attacks and 'take aim' abilities which Can one shot a dps. if they start channeling a take aim they must be killed.
> 
> **Trolls** - As well as archers, each phase will had a troll added to the room. These must be controlled by the tank and if possible killed fast(focus adds not the boss, the boss is on health timers anyway). These can deal high damage and do regular ground stomping aoes. Don't let the trolls live if you can help it.
> 
> **Stomp** - Exactly the same as the behemoth in Maelstrom Arena, the boss will occasionally stomp the ground and rocks will fire across the floor around the room and if caught in the path it will deal moderate damage and interrupt/small knock back.
> 
> **Wamasu Slavers** - During the fight the boss will go Immune to all damage. This will happen based on his max health 3 times the lower he goes (although if you have crazy damage these can overlap and sometimes even skip the last phase). During these phases trolls will come into the room and ONE slaver needs to be killed so they release their Wamasu to help run around killing the adds for you. Be sure that you assign one member of your group to release the Wamasus ONCE per immune phase.
> 
> **Spit/mudcrabs** - During the immune phase the boss will spit on the floor. DO NOT stand in it yet. Look around the room, there are two corners to focus on. One of them with have a geyser of water firing form it, THAT is the direction you need to be headed towards.
> 
> So once your goal/direction is determined, that is when one member from the group (not the tank) needs to run through the spit and go straight to the geyser. The longer you have the goo you just picked up the slower you will move, you have 0 resources and you will take damage from adds throwing stray attacks at you, you will be chased by mudcrabs and yes the boss can choose to charge you during this stage.
> 
> Get as close as you can to the geyser and then drop it. Let another member pick it up and finish the job. It helps if someone is healing you along the way because most die on the run. Once the geyser is plugged, the boss with go into a roar mechanic and he is able to take damage again.
> 
> As stated above, this will happen 3 times during the fight. During these times you must have your tank grab as many adds as possible without dropping the boss. Throwing ultimates after he is no longer immune helps push him to the next phase AND deal with adds fast. But the choice is yours.
> 
> NOTE: As mentioned above, the boss has mechanics based on health amount. SO the faster you burn it, the more mechanics will happen at once and possibly overlap. So to play it safe, take your time! Focus the adds and empty the room and THEN focus the boss. Rinse repeat!
> 
> 
> 
> ZATZU
> 
> 
> ** ZATZU **
> 
> This boss is a borderline 'burn fest' he is not difficult at all but does have some very important basic mechanics which will help you with the Stone Shapers in the remainder of the dungeon. Get your tank to hold the boss as still as possible while turning him away from the group. Key point for this boss however, running around in circles will do nothing. So focus, plant your feet and move when you NEED to, not just because you think it looks cool (spoiler: it doesn't)
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss has an uppercut attack and he will hit whoever has agro (should be the tank) this must be blocked or you will be knocked down.
> 
> **Teleport slam** - The boss will raise his hand in the air and jump up into the sky! He will then land on whoever has agro. With a huge aoe splash. You need to avoid this and stay out of it, but when he lands there will also be rocks that fly across the floor OUTSIDE of the AOE. Even if you are out of the aoe, be sure to block when he lands.
> 
> **Flying rocks** - During the fight the boss will stop attacking and channel a casting ability. This will make rocks appear in the air and attack the group over and over until the channeling is over. During this phase you must block else you will be knocked down. These deal moderate damage but while knocked down if another hits you while you are down (too slow to react) you can end up dead. EXACTLY the same as the 75% and under phases on the second boss in Aetherian Archive.
> 
> 
> 
> THE MIGHTY CHUDAN
> 
> 
> ** THE MIGHTY CHUDAN **
> 
> This boss can be extremely simple if the mechanics are followed but many think that they have to run around in circles and all will be ok...WRONG. This room is massive, so the more you run around the harder it is to keep people alive and control things. The boss needs to taunt the boss and keep it faced away from the group at all times. The hit box of the boss can be a little tricky so dps MAY want to highlight/tab target the boss.
> 
> **Spit (heavy attack mechanic)** - During the fight Chudan will wind up a heavy attack. This is unlike the regular kind. You do need to block as much of the damage as possible but she will spit at the target (should be the tank) multiple times in a very short period of time causing MASSIVE damage and laying aoes on the ground. Everyone must stay out of the aoes and the tank must not spin the boss around.
> 
> Note: If you are a Dragonknight with wings or as a tank you have defensive stance or spell wall, this will reflect the spit back at the boss...this will take timing. You can also dodge roll it to some extent but timing again is key. Above all, be sure to block it and the healer needs to focus you.
> 
> NOTE: if you are a dps and this is on you, you need to dodge roll 3 times, once a second(which will kill your resources) else you are dead...basically for the tank...DON'T drop the boss!!
> 
> **Haj-mota adds** - During the fight there will be haj-mota adds spawning two at a time. They are smaller than the regular ones in the dungeon but it helps if you can get rid of these else you can get overwhelmed quickly especially when they start diving at the group!
> 
> **Archers** - During the fight there will long ranged archers in the room. If the tank can manage to it helps to have these chained into the boss (careful not to spin the boss). These spawn over and over and if you do not kill them fast they will overwhelm the group!
> 
> **Lightning Shield** - During the fight there is an argonian with a large lightning shield over it. This target cannot be attacked by players, but will hit the group constantly with lightning attacks while it is alive...more below.
> 
> **CHARGE!!** - The boss will pick a random player and a big fast spreading aoe under their feet will start to spread...Don't try to run away from it, it is on YOU!. Remember the lightning guy above? well THIS is how you stop him. Take that aoe and stand infront of him.
> 
> Once the aoe hits peek..cChudan will take a massive underground dive at YOU. Just before it reaches you, you need to dodge roll. Chudan will go straight past and destroy the lightning guy and his shield. From here on out it is rinse repeat until it happens again, new haj-motas, new archers etc.
> 
> 
> 
> TREE-MINDER NA-KESH
> 
> 
> ** TREE-MINDER NA-KESH **
> 
> This boss is every P.U.G's nightmare because of what i generally call 'execute panic!'. Basically what i mean is, people look at the boss's health and assume it is almost dead so ignore all mechanics...THAT will get you killed here. You must focus mechanics at all times, ESPECIALLY during execute. Get your tank to hold the boss still and taunt as you would with any other boss fight and the dps in a semi circle behind her. And get ready to focus on whatever happens next. This will require a confident or at least competent tank!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - Easy to see this one, dual wield heavy attack! You see this winding up, you block it! Tank or not. This has a big knock back but if you are blocking it will barely scratch you.
> 
> **Totem** - The boss will spawn a totem from the ground during the fight. When this appears the tank needs to apply a debuff to it if possible (piece armour) and stack the boss on top of it. The group need to 100% focus this as soon as possible. During it's life time it will drain players of all their resources in a very short period of time until nothing is left and then keep you at 0. This MUST be killed, there will be one every phase (unless you skip phases with high damage). The start of the fight being phase one.
> 
> **Spirit Phase** - at 70% and 50% she will hide in her cage and be immune to all damage while summoning a spirit of a previous boss to fight you. First at 70% it will be Chudan. Be sure that you tank is WIDE awake for this since she will spawn heavy attacking and if the tank doesn't taunt fast enough you will loose a player to a one shot. This phase you can kill it fast and get back on with the boss OR you can take your time and build ultimate up. The choice is yours. Once the boss is dead she will leave the cage and the fight continues. This will happen again at 50% but this time you will fight Xal Nur again instead.
> 
> **Adds** - IF you have low damage these can spawn before she goes into the cage at 70% however if you have avoided them spawning they WILL spawn afterwards when she leaves her cage at 70% and 50%.
> 
> These adds consist of close range and long range squishies and also one of the nastiest of them all, the 'Stone Shapers'. Remember the mechanics for these guys. They must be focused and they must be blocked if rocks are in the air!
> 
> The tank should grab as many adds as possible INCLUDING the Stone Shaper (infact he is more important) and stack them all with the boss and root them. Don't let the adds run off and power up in the amber plasm pools.
> 
> While the adds are up you are very likely to get a totem. So if that happens, stack EVERYTHING including the boss on top of the totem and the group need to kill it asap or you are likely to wipe. You need a lot of aoe for this so keep your dots down while the adds are in the room. If you get agro from any adds, and you are not the tank, do NOT run away. If you run around in circles you WILL get hit in the back of the head, you WILL make a mess of it all and you WILL die...FOCUS!
> 
> **Statues** - When the boss spirits are killed and she is released 70%/50% she will curse ONE member of the group. They will have their screen go into some rather funky dream like colours and they will have all of their abilities changed to the same skill (no heals no damage, no buffs just one spamable). The group can see which statue around the room is lit up. SO the cursed one needs to let the group know they are cursed, and the group should all move TOGETHER to the correct statue so the one who is cursed can attack the correct statue. Breaking the statue will remove the curse. This will take serious co-ordination. You can reveal it for your team mate via a synergy but running together taking the boss and adds with you is much safer. This phase will also happen at 30% and below when she goes into an enraged state, so you must focus here.
> 
> This mechanic will happen as mentioned above a total of 3 times 70% after spirit, 50% after spirit and 30% and below at execute.
> 
> Special note: So long as the tank has a taunt on the boss she will NOT curse them. So be sure to taunt the boss before she leaves the cage, else things get messy fast.
> 
> **Execute** - The final phase is what i call 'execute panic' people see disco lights and go crazy jumping around, do NOT do this. The boss at 30% and below will go into enraged mode and do a disco light type spinning aoe effect which will shoot roots at the players doing damage and slowing them down. You can technically wiggle a little bit to get in the gaps but so much is going on it is safer to just focus on your job.
> 
> Keep her taunted at all times, keep the heals coming and keep the damage and rotations up and it is a lot more relaxed than it looks.
> 
> KEY points:
> 
> Kill and control all adds.
> 
> Kill the totem at all costs
> 
> Cleanse the final curse
> 
> If you follow the above, relax, don't run around in circles and work together as a team, the execute is easy. BUT if you start panicking and running around the room, it is all over. You MUST focus on this final phase no matter how long it takes you. The aoe effects 'look scary' but they are not as bad as they look.

> Good luck!!!
