### 腐臭的里纳埃鲁斯

> RINAERUS THE RANCID


**欧兹恩·臭味和里纳鲁斯·恶臭**

这个首领真的为地牢设定了基调。有多个事情同时发生，所以人们必须非常专注并注意脚下的情况。这场战斗中的一个主要机制将为最后一个首领的超难机制做准备，所以请注意！坦克应该抓住两个首领（一个用远程嘲讽，一个用近战嘲讽）。远程嘲讽应该在中间的Boss（Rinaerus）上，近战嘲讽应该在近战Boss（Orzun）上。近战Boss需要远离其他Boss，它们一定不能在一起。如果它们在一起，它们的负面AOE圆圈会重叠并使它们变得更强，从而导致组队失败。务必让近战Boss远离施法者。

* **重击** :  在战斗中，奥兹恩会对威胁他的人（应该是坦克）使用致命的重击。如果你是坦克，请格挡它；如果你不是坦克，但因为某种奇怪的原因，他把你作为输出或治疗目标，请及时闪避（不要试图格挡，他会把你消灭）。

* **雪鼠** :  如果你已经到了这里，你一定已经见过这些怪物了。中间的远程BOSS会召唤雪鼠加入战斗。当Rinaerus在吟唱时，需要打断他，否则雪鼠会生成！因此，这个机制在技术上是可以避免的。

* **这些敌人通常会同时出现3** : 4只，攻击力不算太强，但应该要迅速击败它们。小心它们的尸体，因为即使死了，它们也会在地上爬行，从身体中喷出毒液，持续一小段时间。如果你被其中一只毒害了，它们就能够很快地杀死你。因此，这里的危险在于当它们死亡时，你可能会踩到它们，而不是它们还活着的时候。坦克可以嘲讽并控制它们，但实际上并不需要，而且你还会冒着堆积太多负面AOE的风险。因此，理论上DPS应该快速击败它们，直到AOE消失才靠近尸体。

* **雪震** :  在战斗中地面上会有许多移动的冰刺。避免触碰到这些，否则你会被震晕。不过，这里有一个机制需要利用这些东西。在战斗中，地面上会有一个小冰霜区域，成为一个快速移动的小圆圈并朝你飞来（每个玩家都会受到这个攻击）。当它出现时，你将会收到一条消息，提示"Orzun已对你使用了雪震"。这时，找到一个移动的冰刺的位置，故意站在上面。你会被震晕，雪震也会触发并让你安全地解除束缚（区域会爆炸并消失）。

如果你在这个阶段不站在冰块上，那么范围攻击会抓住你，打击你并杀死你。

* **冰柱** :  在Rinaerus期间，他会短时间向玩家释放冰风暴并且地面会喷发冰柱。你必须尽快躲到这些冰柱后面并且待在那里，直到他的攻击结束。如果你没有足够快地到达柱子，你将被完全停顿并且冻死。在这个阶段，你必须准备好躲藏或死亡。

* **激怒** :  如果你把BOSS放在一起，它们会激怒并杀死整个团队。此外，如果你在杀死一个食人魔之前先杀死另一个，那么几秒钟后剩下的那个会激怒并造成更大的伤害（基本上能够消灭整个团队）。所以简而言之，先把一个BOSS的血量打到很低，然后集中攻击另一个。然后尽力让它们最终在大致相同的时间内或接近同时被杀死。

堆叠攻击会使它们愤怒，过早击杀其中一个会使另一个变得愤怒。简单易懂！





### “铁心”多来米什

> DOYLEMISH IRONHEART


**DOYLEMISH IRONHEART** 
（注意：此处为游戏内的格式，不是 html 标签） 
DOYLEMISH IRONHEART（道义仪斯·铁心）是老一辈的格斗家，生活在弓月洞穴中。在他青年时期，他是一名擅长格斗技巧的战士，并经常在公共竞技场中进行表演和比赛。不过，他最后离开了公共场合，转而在弓月洞穴中度过余生。现在，他已经年迈，但仍然保持着惊人的力量和技巧。在 Elder Scrolls Online 中，DOYLEMISH IRONHEART 是一个严重的威胁，需要小心处理。

这场战斗绝对是团队中PUG的杀手，因为总会有那些总是逃跑的人搞砸一切！这个游戏中基本的仇恨机制是坦克使用嘲讽技能，其他人除了特殊机制要求以外都不要去引怪。如果你作为DPS/治疗获得了仇恨，你绝对不要从坦克那里逃跑。将小怪/首领带到坦克旁边，不要惊慌失措！这样做没有任何帮助而只会破坏团队。

为什么这在战斗中很重要？因为你会被那些坦克无法控制的东西追逐，现在轮到你放松，理解保持接近和不要惊慌的重要性了！其中的专有名词不需翻译。

坦克应该让boss站在原地并面向门。其他所有人（包括治疗师）都应该尽可能地靠近boss，在一圈中准备应对机制。无论发生什么事情都不要开始向Grahtwood逃跑！

* **重击** :  这个机制非常简单，如果坦克曾经参加过纺锤洞穴II并面对血咒先驱，那么这个机制就很明显。首领会对坦克进行重击。要么格挡它，要么就会死亡。如果这个攻击出现在dps或治疗身上（无论出于何种怪异的原因），那么就进行翻滚。如果你不是坦克，格挡无法拯救你。

* **冰霜之怒** :  这些是低血量的小兵，将在战斗中刷新，如果不消灭它们，它们会释放许多难以应对的冰系aoe攻击和击倒效果。只要保持足够的AOE伤害输出，这些小兵并不太难处理。坦克可以嘲讽它们，但通常更安全的做法是坦克专注于BOSS。不要四处乱跑，它们只会追着你跑！杀掉它们。

* **不要站在傻瓜区** :  在战斗中，地面上会有大型AOE效果，这些效果非常容易发现，简单地移动你的脚，不要站在它们上面。如果你站在上面，你会受到伤害，治疗师将不得不花费很大力气来维持你的生命值。它们不是一次性的杀手，但它们会造成难以承受的伤害。

* **Bleed** :  坦克会从Boss身上受到流血伤害，治疗师需要清除/治愈这种伤害。

* **地面重击** :  Boss 偶尔会在自己脚底下猛击地面，形成小范围 AoE。千万不要站在里面。

* **激光** :  魔球发射的激光会跟随人们移动，只要动动脚步，不要被激光追到，否则会被石化。

* **侍灵** :  这些漂浮的死亡球体将在Boss的生命值达到一定的百分比时攻击小组。它们会在Boss生命值的80%、60%、40%和20%时刷新。一定要集中攻击它们。它们会选择小组中的一个玩家并直接攻击他们。被选中的目标会在他们脚下产生一个小型的脉动区域指示他们是攻击目标。这个球体移动缓慢，但当它接近目标时，它会将他们变成石头。

这个战斗的关键是让AOE伤害保持在Boss处，并让队伍紧紧团结在Boss附近。这样，当大球接近队伍时，它会同时受到Boss的被动伤害。除了AOE伤害以外，队伍现在应该集中所有的单体伤害来杀死球。

如果它把任何人变成石头，你必须立即解救他们。如果你不解救他们，那么首领将发动一次秒杀攻击。这个攻击可以被打断，但他会变得更加狂暴并变得更加强大，所以关键在于尽可能地靠近彼此，同时避免AOE伤害，一旦有人被变成石头，就使用联动效果解救他们。在某人被变成石头后，球会选择一个不同的目标，并重复该过程直到球死亡。

注意：如果你逃跑，它会追你。当你最终被石化（而且面对现实，大多数人都不会真正“引导”它远离并将其杀掉），他们离队伍太远了，无法去解救他们，并会在到达之前死亡。然后球会交给他们，反复洗礼。保持紧密联系，可以更快地恢复，正如视频所示。保持在一起速度更快，每个人都放下了伤害，物品被承受，治疗在一个地方；)





### 首领阿尔蒂斯

> MATRIARCH ALDIS


** 首领阿尔蒂斯（又名“VMA闪回！”）**

这是另一个需要小队合作的首领。这个首领很容易理解，但很多人低估了机制的重要性，并且一遍又一遍地失败了。在这场战斗中，节奏是关键。过度烧杀会导致失败，因为她的血量极低，机制也在非常规律的时间弹出。首领应该被守卫在房间中央，这样当你试图击杀小怪时，她不会挡着你的路，你也不会在击杀小怪时意外给她造成额外的伤害。下面的机制将更清楚地说明这一点，但再次记住，节奏是关键。不要在战斗开始时放出必杀技并期望烧杀掉它，你会死的（是的，我们曾经这样做过，很多人也这样做过，但那真的非常难）。

* **VMA ICE** :  正如VMA冰回合(竞技场5)，冰水会杀死你，所以要远离它！

* **Plug the ice** :  首领会咏唱并在地面上形成一个小冰刺，坦克必须站在上面并堵住洞口，否则团队将会受到巨额伤害。其中，黄色部分为HTML标记，不需要翻译。

* **恐惧** :  战斗时Boss偶尔会使整个队伍陷入恐慌，让你随机逃跑（有时甚至逃到冰里）。如果发生这种情况，只需解除恐惧并继续战斗即可。

* **Leminids（柠檬星际）** :  Leminids，也称为Lemonades，是这场战斗的关键问题。如果你被这些怪物淹没，你们全都会死。这个Boss的血量非常低，因此需要像我上面说的那样控制节奏！这是因为这些Leminids每10%就会一直刷新！没错，每10%你都会有一个小怪出现，而且必须立即处理。在90％、80％、70％、60％、50％、40％、30％、20％和10％的时候，你会在房间里随机遇到一个这样的怪物，DPS必须迅速从Boss身上抽身去攻击这个小怪。如果小怪没有及时击杀，地上就会出现活动泉，在这种情况下，DPS/治疗一般来说是很难生存下来的，除非他们已经满血并站在恢复范围内。因此，最好始终为团队保持一些治疗，即使他们没有受到伤害，以防万一。

如果你超强攻击boss，你会得到多个莱明尼德，并且这将是一场地狱！它们的轻攻击会压倒小组，且喷泉太多将无法处理。

如果坦克能在中心位置施加远程嘲讽效果，同时保持不动，则对这些情况有帮助！不要移动首领！

* **践踏** :  Boss会时不时制造出像扩散AOE一样的巨大践踏，你必须避开。坦克可以格挡它，但团队必须往后移动并躲开，否则除非有完整的抵抗和伤害盾否则基本上就会一击必杀。

* **跳** :  这就是为什么坦克应该保持BOSS不动，而不是围着近战的Leminids乱跑和嘲讽。总是用远程嘲讽保持距离并坚守你所在的位置。无论谁拥有仇恨（是的，这也适用于坦克放弃嘲讽），如果他们离得很远，BOSS就会跳到他们那里。这意味着如果坦克跑去嘲讽别的什么东西，BOSS将会跳到他们的头上来抓住他们。这将会从BOSS目标的位置制造一次大规模的AOE震荡攻击。你想避免让这个机制发生，因为非常有可能会让它落在整个团队的头上。





### 瘟疫调制者莫提乌

> PLAGUE CONCOCTER MORTIEU


**瘟疫调制者莫提乌**

这个BOSS可能是迄今为止最酷的BOSS战之一。这是一场非常有趣和积极的战斗，具有一些独特的机制。坦克应该将BOSS保持在房间的中央。在这里，坦克必须关注许多事情（下面解释），而且位于房间中央使得机动性更加容易，而且不会出现到达某些位置时间过长的情况。如果坦克太慢，人们将会死亡！小组在打BOSS时应该在BOSS后面形成半圆形，除非当然要处理其他机制。

* **毒烤架** :  这就是我要求坦克随时站在房间中央的原因。地面上布满了烤架。每个都可能会向小队发射毒素，在很短的时间内造成巨大的伤害。坦克必须尽快到达活动的烤架，坐在上面并按住格挡，以此将伤害从小队身上承受。每次坦克通过格挡成功保护小队，都应该回到房间中央准备格挡下一个烤架。许多坦克犯了一个错误，就是站在他们上次的位置上（因此即使一个烤架消失了，他们还在那里一直插盾）...这可能会造成问题。例如，如果坦克站在房间最远的角落，而一个新的烤架产生在房间的另一边，他/她永远无法到达，小队将会死亡。专注于贴近房间中央，并始终回到位置，可以使每次运行时间更短，对小队的危险性也更小。

* **箭雨** :  BOSS会释放一个锥形区域伤害，就像玩家在弓技能栏中使用的弓箭雨能力一样。非常容易避开。他会选择任何他喜欢的目标，简单地避开即可。如果被击中，你将承受毒性伤害，并很快死亡！

* **火焰** :  首领会在地面上施放一个小的扩散AOE。这时要准备远离它并观察自己的脚。一旦它弹出来，就会在地面上沿着四个不同方向发射火线。简单地向一侧移动，这样火线就能从你身边通过，不要站在上面。如果被击中，你将会持续受到大量火属性伤害。

* **瞄准** :  Boss会试图用一个巨大的单体攻击技能狙击小组中的一个成员。这需要尽快打断，以防止潜在的一个DPS /治疗师被秒杀。

* **制作药剂** :  这关重点在于击败小怪，必须按顺序击败！Jorvuld需要生物的某些部位来制造药剂。他会在战斗中喊出他需要的部位，所以最好打开字幕。除非他询问特定的部位，否则始终将焦点放在BOSS上。首先，你需要杀死小鬼，然后在第二阶段，你需要杀死缠绕者，第三阶段你需要杀死甲虫。每个阶段，房间里都会充满毒药，你的治疗师只需让你保持活力，同时专注于BOSS和所需的小怪。一旦他获得所需的部位，他将向房间中投掷药剂。此阶段的BOSS将被震晕，房间中将出现正面的AOE。尽快站在一起，你将获得巨大的奖励，并解除毒药影响。

你可以获得的奖励是伤害和恢复增加，同时伤害和终极技能再生速度也会增加。在这个阶段，你需要把Boss打得一文不值，因为你的伤害输出几乎翻倍！

* **守卫** :  当BOSS被Jorvuld的药剂定住时，一名守卫将进入战斗。他的血量对于Add来说相当高，并且如果不闪避，他会进行一次重击攻击。一旦坦克发现这一点，他应该将守卫拉到BOSS身边并与其叠加。如果DPS专注攻击，你可以在伤害提升BUFF持续期间快速击败这个ADD。如果无法击败它，就先集中攻击它再继续攻击BOSS。





### 唤鳞者赞恩

> ZAAN THE SCALECALLER


**唤鳞者赞恩**

这个BOSS需要组队全力以赴，并且必须协作，否则不可能成功。坦克需要专注于保持BOSS的仇恨并始终将其背向团队，不要让它转圈！当房间里有小怪时，当然也必须嘲讽它们并将它们稳定。每个成员都必须清楚自己在做什么，了解每个阶段并准备好。在这场战斗中，鲁莽和英雄主义只会导致失败。一定要合作！

编队方面，我在视频中非常清晰地演示了如何站立。请在与中间龙和右侧龙之间的间隙直线上排队。这将为我将要解释的所有机制做好准备！

* **Leminid and Atronach** :  这里有两个血量较低的小怪，一个是Leminid，另一个是Frost Atronach。它们必须死掉，但要小心。一旦Atronach死了，它会掉落第一位Boss的冰机关（移动的尖刺）。请勿站在上面。Leminid死后，她会掉落一个毒气泉……请勿站在上面！如果你站在任意一种机关上，它们会让你眩晕，并把这个效果带出房间。你需要这些效果！

在击杀小怪时一定要确保它们堆叠在首领身上（总是使用终极技能来攻击小怪），并保持治疗持续高强。对于这个困难模式而言，主要问题在于大范围的持续伤害。因此，持续治疗是至关重要的。直接攻击会使你立即死亡，所以不要浪费时间施展"生命之息"，通常为时已晚。

再次强调一下，把小兵们聚集在一起，如果有终极技能使用，当它们死了以后，避免踩到它们掉落的AOE技能范围，保持你的队列。冰块会移动，所以注意你的位置。这些小兵会在赞恩（即将到来）护盾时再次出现。

* **激光** :  激光将不断在房间中移动。就像冰块和间歇泉一样，必须避免。被它击中会变成石头。现在，这个是会重新出现的，不像前面的两个，但你要尽可能避免接触它，直到以后。

* **黎明裂魂重攻击** :  战斗首领黎明裂魂/重攻击会攻击仇恨值最高的人（一般是坦克），这不仅会造成直接伤害，还会造成小范围范围伤害。如果你不是坦克，请不要站在它的攻击范围内，如果你是坦克，请确保自己处于格挡状态，而不是逃跑。这个攻击是有延迟的动画效果，一定会攻击到你。

* **火息攻击** :  Boss将会选择一个目标，并对其进行持续喷出火息的攻击。每一个攻击都必须被躲避。我见过很多人在击杀其它小怪的同时四处逃窜。这是至关重要的直线队形的原因之一。如果你受到了火息攻击，向左边躲避，绕着整个小队走一个大圈。这将使持续攻击不会覆盖整个小队，并且你也不会被攻击到。在最后一次攻击之前，你就会回到原来的位置了。

然而，如果你被困住了并且上述策略不可行，那就尽可能地后退，在火焰中绕来绕去直到它们消失。

* **火焰光束** :  这个技能将选择一名玩家，用火焰光束将其悬浮在空中并迅速消耗其生命值！这看起来和赞恩怪物头盔的效果完全相同。如果有人被困在其中，他们将持续受到伤害，直到效果结束或死亡为止。当发生这种情况时，必须有人挡住光束并格挡以减少一部分伤害。坦克可以直接站在光束中挡住，但如果坦克是目标，那么DPS和治疗者可能需要快速通过1次闪避来迅速减轻一些伤害。不过如果是脆皮角色，不能闪避太久，否则会死亡。

* **冰雕** :  每次首领到达20%的检查点时（她会完成当前的机制，所以你可以过度燃烧），在80％、60％、40％和20％时，她会无敌并在房间里召唤三个冰雕。留意地面上的冰痕，看它们指向她从哪里召唤。这是“集火或死亡”。基本上必须尽可能快地杀死所有3个雕像。当它们还活着时，小组将承受巨大的冰伤害。这是治疗师必须集中精力控制的一点——必须用治疗术来抵消巨大的伤害。滥用“呼吸生命”的治疗术会导致有人死亡。集中精力保护小组并确保你在这里的任务。此外，作为治疗师，如果你有壁垒，这可能会有所帮助。

一旦冰雕被摧毁，赞恩将放下她的护盾，所有3个龙雕像会喷出毒气并覆盖整个房间！你的反应时间非常有限，这将转入下一个机制！

* **救命啊** :  我之前提到的要避免的三个机制是激光束、地下脉冲和地上的冰块？实际上现在有四个了！赞恩掉下来的护盾就是剩下的第四个机制。

一旦冰相已经结束并且所有小怪都死亡，为了在毒气之下生存，你们所有人都必须得到保护。

在普通/史诗模式下，每个人只需贴近唤鳞者赞恩的盾牌就可以保证安全...但在这里却不行！

每个玩家必须分配一种机制。因此，让一个人站在冰上，一个人站在激光束中，一个人站在间歇泉中，一个人站在赞恩的盾牌中，并使用协同作用！

如果每个人都能成功地独立进入机制，以便在毒素发射的时间内完成，那么每个人都会活下来。如果一个人失败了，或者如果机制在此阶段之前被占领而他们无处可去，那么他们就死了。一击必杀！

“我的盾牌！”——当BOSS尖叫“我的盾牌”时，没有任何人可以站在她的盾牌范围内。她会跑过去保护自己并从地上拿起盾牌。她重新拿起盾牌后，战斗重复进行（下面会解释其中的变化）。她必须与小怪站在一起并堆叠在一起，这样团队就可以燃烧原始的“直线”阵型中的小怪。每20%就要重复这个过程。基本上这是一场一遍又一遍的战斗，直到她死亡，但现在在第一个成功的盾牌阶段之后，房间内有毒药。

* **毒气吐息** :  如果你成功地度过了第一阶段的冰冻、晕眩、毒素、护盾等等，你将会回到你的队形中击杀小怪并留意机制......但是，现在雕像们醒了！这是所有原因中最主要的。每隔几秒钟，一座龙雕像会在随机位置造成一个巨大的三角形吐息范围，任何被困在其中的人都会死亡。无论是格挡还是翻滚都没有用，你都会死亡。

因此要保持直线，这条线必须经过两个可能的毒药位置之一。一旦看到线，立即向右或向左一起迈步。这样做可以确保你保持队形，控制好一切，并且不会被秒杀。如果有人认为自己更聪明，开始在房间里乱跑或者走得太远离队形，那么他们会冒着巨大的死亡风险。

保持集中并保持队形。

老滚在线攻略要点如下：

1. The Atronach => 侍灵
2. Dragon => 龙
3. Skeevers => 雪鼠
4. Snipe => 狙击
5. Mor => 莫尔
6. Plague Concocter Mortieu => 瘟疫调制者莫提乌
7. Ri => 里
8. Matriarch Aldis => 首领阿尔蒂斯
9. Ak => 阿克
10. Zaan the Scalecaller => 唤鳞者赞恩
11. Guard => 守卫

重要提示：请记住这些专有名词，以帮助您更好地理解游戏中出现的角色和物品名称。

使用终极技能清除小兵，不要踩在范围伤害区域内并保持直线阵型。

每当BOSS的生命值降低20%，请击杀3个雕像，进入分配好的AOE区域并且存活于AOE中的毒药攻击中。

当唤鳞者赞恩去取她的盾牌时，准备回到位置（直线）上，并释放终极技能攻击小兵，然后重复执行此步骤。

直线走位对于毒气和火焰喷吐至关重要，要集中注意力。

祝你们好运，愉快游戏！

> **  ORZUN THE FOUL-SMELLING & RINAERUS THE RANCID **
> 
> This boss really sets the tone for the dungeon. There are multiple things going on at once so people have to really focus and watch their feet. One of the major mechanics in this fight will prepare you for one of the hard mode mechanics of the last boss so pay attention! The tank should grab BOTH bosses (one with a ranged taunt and one with a melee taunt). The ranged taunt should be on the middle boss (Rinaerus) and the melee taunt on the melee boss (Orzun). The melee ogre needs to be moved AWAY from the other, they must NOT stay together. If they stay together, their negative AOE circle will overlap and they will get stronger and wipe the group. Keep the melee away from the caster at all costs.
> 
> **Heavy attack**  - During the fight Orzun will throw out a nasty heavy attack at whoever has agro (should be the tank) If you are a tank BLOCK IT, if you are not and for some strange reason as a dps or healer he is aiming at YOU, dodge roll it on time (don't even try to block it he will annihilate you).
> 
> **Skeevers** - You have seen these already if you have gotten this far. The ranged boss in the middle will call skeevers to the fight. When Rinaerus is channeling he will need to be Interrupted, else the skeevers will spawn! So yes this mechanic is technically avoidable.
> 
> These are usually about 3-4 at a time and don't hit too hard but they should be dispatched quickly. Be careful of your feet because these will lay on the ground while dead and shoot poison from their bodies for a short period of time. If you get hit by even a couple of these they can kill you fast. So the danger here is standing on them when they are dead, not so much when they are alive. The tank can taunt, pin these if they like but there is really no need, AND you run the risk of having too many stacked up negative aoes. So realistically the dps should get these down fast and just stay away from the bodies until the aoe fades.
> 
> **Snow Tremor**  - During the fight there will be many moving ice spikes on the ground. Avoid these else you will be stunned HOWEVER!, there is a mechanic these are required for. There will be a small ice aoe in the form of a fast moving tiny circle heading towards you in the fight (each player will get this). When it happens you will be prompted with a message saying 'Orzun has targeted you with a snow tremor'. When this happens, find one of the moving spike filled aoes and DELIBERATELY stand in it. You will be stunned, the tremor will hit you and you will be broken free and safe (aoe explodes and goes away).
> 
> If however you do NOT stand in the ice at this stage, the aoe will catch you, hit you and kill you.
> 
> **Ice Pillars** - During Rinaerus will channel ice storm at the players for a short period of time and the ground will errupt with ice pillars. You MUST get behind these ice pillars as fast as possible and stay behind them until his attack is over. If you do not get to the pillars fast enough you will be snared to a complete stop and freeze to death. This phase you MUST be ready to hide or die.
> 
> **Enrage**  - If you stack the bosses they will enrage and kill the group. Also, if you kill one ogre before the other then the remaining one after a few seconds will enrage and hit MUCH harder (basically capable of wiping the group). So in short, push one boss to low health and then focus the other. Then try to kill them BOTH eventually at roughly the same time, or close to.
> 
> Stacking makes them enrage, killing one too early makes the other enrage. Simple!

> DOYLEMISH IRONHEART

> **  DOYLEMISH IRONHEART **
> 
> This fight is the PUG killer for sure because this where people who run away all the time mess everything up! The basic mechanic of agro in this game is that the tank taunts, and everyone else is fine (excluding mechanics). If YOU as a dps/healer have agro you should NEVER run away from the tank. Bring adds/bosses to the tank and don't panic! It doesn't help and just ruins groups.
> 
> Why is this important in this fight? because you WILL get chased by stuff the tank cannot control and it is now up to YOU to relax, understand the importance of staying close and NOT panic!
> 
> The tank should hold the boss still and face the door. Everyone else (yes healers this means you too) should be as close as possible in a circle around the boss and get ready to take on the mechanics. No matter what happens do NOT start running to Grahtwood!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is extremely straight forward and if the tank has ever done Spindle Clutch II and faced Bloodspawn, this is an obvious mechanic. The boss will do a heavy attack at the tank. Block it or die. If this for any weird reason is on the dps/healer, then dodge roll. Block wont save you if you are not a tank.
> 
> **Ice Wraths** - These are low health adds which will spawn during the fight, these must be killed else lots of nasty ice aoes and knock downs will happen from them. They are not so difficult to deal with so long as you keep a decent amount of aoe dps down on the ground. The tank can taunt these but generally it is safer for the tank to keep focus on the boss. Do NOT run around the room, they will just chase you! Kill them.
> 
> **Don't Stand In Stupid!** - During the fight there will be large AOE effects on the ground, these are extremely easy to spot, simple move your feet and don't stand in them. If you do you will take damage and the healer will have to work pretty hard to keep you up. They are not one shots by any mean but they do offer nasty damage over time.
> 
> **Bleed** - The tank will receive bleed damage from the boss which the healer will need to keep on top of to cleanse/heal through.
> 
> **Ground Pound** - The boss will occasionally pound the ground in a small aoe under his feet. Do NOT stand in this.
> 
> **Lasers** - The lasers from the orbs will follow people around a bit, just move your feet and don't get caught else they will turn you to stone.
> 
> **Spheres!!!** - These floating balls of death will attack the group at set % of health of the boss. These spawn at 80% 60% 40% and 20%. These MUST be focused. They will pick one player of the group and go straight for them. The target will have a small pulsing aoe under their feet to indicate they are the target. The ball moves slowly but when it reaches them it will turn them to stone.
> 
> The trick to this is to keep aoe down where the boss is and stay CLOSE to the boss together. That way when the gets close to the group it takes passive damage at the same time as the boss. BUT as well as aoe damage the group should now FOCUS all single target damage on the ball to kill it.
> 
> IF it turns anyone to stone, then you must break them free IMMEDIATELY. If you do not break them free the boss will channel up a one shot. This CAN be interrupted but he will enrage and get stronger, so the key here is to stay as close as possible to each other while avoiding aoes and the second someone is turned to stone, break them out with a synergy. After they are turned to stone the ball will pick a different target and so on until it is dead.
> 
> NOTE: IF you run away, it will chase you and when you eventually get turned to stone (and lets face it most people are not capable of actually 'kiting' it away and killing it) they will be WAY too far away for the group to go and break them free and they will die before anyone gets there. Then the ball will swap to them and rinse repeat. Stay close together and you can recover faster, as shown in the video. It is much faster paced to stay together, everyone is putting damage down, stuff is tanked and heals are in one place ;)

> ** MATRIARCH ALDIS (AKA 'VMA FLASH BACK!') **
> 
> This is another pug killer right here. A very simple to understand boss but most underestimate the importance of mechanics and inevitably wipe on repeat. PACE is key in this fight. Over burning will result in a wipe because she has EXTREMELY low health and the mechanics pop up at very regular moments. The boss should be tanked in the middle of the room so that when you are trying to kill adds she is not in the way and you don't accidentally do additional damage to her while killing adds. The mechanics below will make more sense as to why this is, but again remember PACE is key. Do NOT drop ultimates on here at the beginning of the fight and expect to burn it, you WILL die (yes we have done it and so have many but it is really rough)
> 
> **VMA ICE!!** - That's right, just like the VMA ice round (arena 5) the ice water will KILL you, so STAY out of it!
> 
> **Plug the ice** - The boss will channel and a small ice spike will start to appear on the floor, the tank must stand on this and plug the hole or the group will take HUGE damage.
> 
> **Fear** - The boss occasionally fear the entire group making you run a random direction (yes sometimes into the ice) If this happens, simply break free and carry on as you were.
> 
> **Leminids** - The Leminids aka Lemonades are the key problem to this fight. IF you get overwhelmed with these you are all going to die. The boss has extremely low health for a boss fight such as this so as i said above pace is key! The reason for this is because these Leminids spawn every '10%'! That's right EVERY 10% you will get an add and HAVE to deal with it. At 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% you will get one of these spawn randomly in the room and the dps must switch their focus from the boss, to the add and fast. If the adds are not killed in time geysers will spawn. DPS/healers generally will not survive them unless they are full health already standing in heals. So it pays to keep some heals down at all times for the group even if they are not taking damage just in case.
> 
> IF you over burn the boss you will get of course MULTIPLE Leminids and this will be hell! The light attacks from them will overwhelm the group and the geysers will be TOO much to deal with.
> 
> What helps with these is if the tank can put a ranged taunt on them while staying IN the middle! Do not move the boss!
> 
> **Stomp** - The boss will occasionally create a massive stomp like spreading aoe which you MUST avoid. The tank can block it but the group must move backwards and get out of it or pretty much take a one shot unless full of resists and damage shields.

> **JUMP!** - This is why the tank should hold the boss still and not run around melee taunting Leminids. Always range taunt them and hold your ground. Whoever has agro (yes this applies to the tank dropping taunt) the boss will JUMP to them if they are far away. This means if the tank runs off to taunt something, the boss will jump on their head to catch them. This creates a massive quake attack in AOE from the location of the boss's target. You want to avoid making this mechanic happen because it is VERY likely you will make it land on the group's head.

> ** PLAGUE CONCOCTER MORTIEU **

> This boss is quite possibly one of the coolest boss fights to date. A very fun and active fight with some unique mechanics. The tank should hold the boss in the MIDDLE of the room. There are many things the tank must focus on in here (explained below) and being positioned in the middle of the room makes maneuverability much easier and there is less chance of taking TOO long to get to certain locations. If the tank is too slow, people will die! The group should stay behind the boss in a semi circle while fighting him unless of course dealing with other mechanics.
> 
> **Poison grills** - This is the reason i tell the tank to stand in the middle of the room at all times. The ground is full of grills. Each one has the potential to cause poison to fire from it at the group causing HUGE damage over a very short period of time. The tank must get to the active grill as soon as possible, sit on it and hold block to take the damage off the group. Every time the tank successfully protects the group by blocking the hole, the tank should get BACK into the middle of the room ready to block the next one. A lot of tanks make the mistake of standing where they last were (so they block one and stay there even though it has gone)...this can create a problem. If for example the tank is at the farthest corner of the room and a new one spawns WAY at the other side of the room, he/she is NEVER going to make it and the group will die. Focusing on hugging the middle and always getting back into position makes each run shorter, and less dangerous for the group.
> 
> **Arrow Spray** - The boss will cast a cone aoe in the form of arrow spray, pretty much the same as the bow ability players have in the bow skill line. This is VERY easy to avoid. He will choose any target he likes, simple don't stand in it. If you are hit you will take poison damage over time and die fast!
> 
> **Fire!** - The boss will cast a small spreading aoe on the floor. When this happens move away from it ready to watch your feet. Once it pops it will emit 4 lines of fire in different directions along the floor. Simply move to one side so it passes you and don't stand in it. If you get hit you will take HIGH fire damage over time.
> 
> **Take aim** - The boss will try to snipe a member of the group with a HUGE single target hard hitting ability. This needs to be interrupted as soon as possible to prevent a potential one shot to a dps/healer.
> 
> **Making The Potion** - This is all about the adds and they must be killed in ORDER! Jorvuld requires parts of creatures for his potions. He will call out which pieces he needs during the fight so it helps if you have subtitles on. Focus the boss at ALL times, unless he asks for specific pieces. Firstly you will need to kill Imps, then the second phase you will have to kill Stranglers and on the 3rd phase you will have to kill Beetles. Each phase the room will be full of poison and your healers will simply have to keep you alive while you focus the boss and the required adds. Once he has all the pieces he needs he will throw a potion into the room. The boss at this stage will be stunned and there will be a POSITIVE aoe in the room. Stand in this together asap and you will be granted with a HUGE bonus and cleansed of the poison.
> 
> The bonuses you can receive are Increased damage and recovery and also increased damage and ultimate regen speed. During this phase you want to burn the boss to hell and back as your damage output is almost doubled!
> 
> **Guard** - While the boss is pinned by the potion from Jorvuld a guard will run into the fight. He has fairly high health for an add and hits with one shot heavy attacks if not block. As soon as the tank spots this, he should be pulled to the boss and stacked with him. If the dps focuses you can kill this add rapidly with your damage increase buff before it runs out. Failing that, focus him first before continuing with the boss.

> ZAAN THE SCALECALLER

> 
> ** ZAAN THE SCALECALLER **
> 
> This boss requires your FULL attention as a group and you MUST work together, else this is not going to happen. The tank needs to focus on holding the boss and turning her away from the group at all times, NO SPINNING! and also when the adds are in the room you must of course taunt them and hold them still too. Each member must know exactly what they are doing, understand each phase and be ready for them. Yoloers and heroes will cause nothing but failure in this fight. Work together!
> 
> Formation wise i make a very clear demonstration in the video about how you should stand. Stand in line with the gap between the middle dragon and the right dragon in a STRAIGHT line. This will prepare you for ALL mechanics i am about to explain!
> 
> **Leminid and Atronach** - There are two adds with lowish health, a Lemonid and a Frost Atronach. These must die BUT be careful. Once the Atronach dies it will drop the ICE mechanic (moving spikes) from the first boss. DO NOT stand in it. And once the Leminid dies, she will drop a poison geyser...do NOT stand in this! If you stand in either of these they will stun you and you will take this effect out of the room. YOU NEED THIS!
> 
> While killing the adds be sure that they are stacked on the boss (use ultimates on the adds always) and keep the heals heavy. The main problem with this hard mode as far as incoming damage is concerned is the amount of aoe dot damage. So hots are essential. Anything that hits directly is a one shot so spamming breath of life is a waste of time, and generally too late.
> 
> SO again to recap, stack the adds, use ultimates if you have them, when they die, AVOID the aoe they drop and stay in your formation. The ice will move around so watch your feet. These adds spawn EVERY time Zaan runs for her shield (coming up later).
> 
> **Laser** - The laser will move around the room all of the time. This just like the ice and the geyser must be avoided. When caught in it you will turn to stone. Now this one DOES re-spawn unlike the two above but you want to avoid this at all costs UNTIL later.
> 
> **Dawnbreaker/heavy attack** - The boss Dawnbreaker/heavy attack the person with agro (should be the tank) This will not only hit with direct damage but ALSO hit in a small aoe too. If you are not a tank, do NOT stand in this, and if you are, make sure you are BLOCKING and not running away. It is delayed animation wise and it WILL catch you.
> 
> **Fire breath** - The boss will pick a target and aim at them with a constant recasting wave of flames like a breath. Each HIT must be avoided. I have seen many people run around and panic while killing the rest of the group. THIS is a very important reason first of all for the straight line formation. If the flames are on you, take a WIDE circle (run) to the left. Quite literally move in ONE large circle from the group, to your left, and back to your group again. THIS will allow it to be OFF the group, it WONT catch you and by the time the last tick hits you will be back in your original position.
> 
> If you are caught out with this one however and the above tactic is not an option, simple stay back as far as possible and weave in and out of the flames until they are gone.
> 
> **Flame Beam** - The will select ONE player and hold them in the air draining their health rapidly with a flaming beam! This looks exactly the same as the Zaan monster helmet effect. If someone is caught in this they will continuously take damage until the effect is over or they die. When this happens, someone must get IN the way of the beam and block to take some of the damage. The tank can literally just stand in it and block, BUT if the tank is the target, then the dps, healer may want to quickly take 1 dodge roll through it just to take the edge off for a quick tick. No longer than a split second as a squishy though because you will die.
> 
> **Ice Statues** - Every time the boss reaches a 20% checkpoint (she will finish her current mechanic so you can over burn) at 80% 60% 40% AND 20% she will be invulnerable and spawn 3 ice statues in the room. Keep an eye on the floor to see the ice trail aiming to where she is summoning them from. This is 'focus or die'. Basically all 3 statues MUST be killed as fast as possible. While they are alive the group will take HUGE ice damage over time. This is where the healer must focus on as much heal over time to counter the huge damage over time. Spamming breath of life will leave someone dead. Focus on what you are doing here and protect the group. Also as a healer if you have barrier, this can help.
> 
> Once the ice statues are down zaan will drop her shield, all 3 dragon statues will breath poison and coat the ENTIRE room! You have VERY limited time to react and this goes into the next mechanic below!
> 
> **Save yourselves!!** - The 3 mechanics above i have mentioned to avoid? The laser beam, the geyser and the ice on the ground? Well technically there are now x4! The shield Zaan dropped is the remaining 4th mechanic.
> 
> As soon as the ice phase is over and all adds are dead, to survive the poison you must ALL be protected.
> 
> On the regular normal/vet mode everyone can just hug Zaan's shield and be safe...but NOT here!
> 
> Every player must be assigned a mechanic. So, have one person stand in ice, one person stand in laser beam, one person stand in the geyser and one person stand in Zaan's shield and take the synergy!
> 
> If each person successfully got into a mechanic on their own, in time for the poison to fire, everyone will survive. If one person fails, or if the mechanics were taken BEFORE this phase and they have no where to go. They are dead. One shot!
> 
> **My Shield!**  - The boss scream 'MY SHIELD', when this happens NO ONE must be standing in her shield. She will run to it to protect herself and pick it back up off the floor. After she has it back the fight repeats itself (with a twist explained below). She must be put with the adds and stacked while the group burn down the adds in their original 'straight line' formation. Rinse repeat this process EVERY 20%. Basically it is the same fight over and over and over until she is dead, but now we have poison in the room after the first successful shield phase.
> 
> **Poison Breath**  - If you have successfully survived the first phase of ice, stuns, poison, shield etc etc. You will or SHOULD be back in your formation killing adds and watching for mechanics...BUT, Now the statues are awake!This is the main reason above all for the straight line. One dragon statue at random every few seconds will create a large triangle breath aoe on the ground and ANYONE caught in it is dead. Blocking or dodge rolling makes no difference you are dead.
> 
> Hence the straight line. The line is to be between one of TWO possible poison locations. As soon as you see it, either step right, or step left, TOGETHER. Doing this will make sure that you stay in formation, everything is controlled and you don't take one shots. If anyone decides they think they know better and starts running around the room or going too far out of formation, they run a MASSIVE risk of dying.
> 
> Focus and stay in formation.
> 
> SO, key points.
> 
> Kill adds with ultimates, don't pick up aoes and stay in a straight line.
> 
> Every 20% health , kill 3 statues, get IN your assigned aoes and survive the aoe poison.
> 
> When Zaan goes to get her shield get ready to get back into position (straight line) to drop ultimates on the adds and rinse repeat.
> 
> Straight line is key for the poison and the flame breath so focus.
> 
> Best of luck to you all and have fun!!
