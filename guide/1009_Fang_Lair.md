## 獠牙巢穴





### 莉扎贝特·查尼斯

> LIZABET CHARNIS


**莉扎贝特·查尼斯**

这个首领实际上是由首领本身控制的多波小怪。任何处理大量垃圾包/拉取/怪物的人都应该能够管理这个战斗。确保你们都集中在房间中央。让坦克尽可能地去引怪，而你们则留在治疗和输出之中。这个战斗需要使用链子/控场技能。不要惊慌，也不要四处乱跑，否则会混乱不堪。这个战斗的诀窍是尽可能保持大范围伤害，以应对所有的小怪，同时处理大的怪物。

* **鬼魂** :  每个阶段首领都会召唤幽灵，它们会出现在房间外（相当远的地方），它们会发射高伤害的冰光攻击和移动迅速的地面冰云。作为DPS和/ 或治疗者必须避免受到攻击，它们会使你瘫痪并造成高伤害。一旦它们进入房间，请确保你的坦克尽快将它们拉到中心部位，以便快速击杀它们！

* **骨巨像** :  在每个波中都会出现一个骨巨像。它们的攻击相当强劲，应该由坦克控制，但尽快由 DPS 集中攻击击败它们。它们有一个讨厌的扩散 AOE，当它达到最大半径时会爆发，造成高伤害和击倒效果。你可以格挡伤害，但仍会被击倒，或者你可以简单地闪避/逃离该 AOE。

注意：最后一波有两个这样的，你应该真正保留你的终极技能来处理这个阶段。





### 骸骨熊

> CADAVEROUS BEAR


** 尸熊 **

这场战斗会导致PUG解散！这场战斗会使你的团队崩溃或者胜利！你们需要协调一致并坚持你们的计划。如果有一个人试图做英雄，这场战斗就结束了！坦克应该抓住所有三个敌人并将它们聚在一起。你需要让它们尽可能远离3只狼/狗，这样它们就需要更好地准备和反应来进入战斗。其原因是时间紧迫，需要更多的时间来做出反应和准备来迎战。

* **虎豹座狮** :  这是房间里最大的难题。你应该尽快集中火力攻击虎豹座狮，他会被固定在地面上一段时间。他可以被嘲讽，但会偶尔攻击他喜欢的人，所以不要逃跑，他的攻击并不算特别强，但你需要让他靠近其他首领并集中攻击。一旦他坐下，你就可以专注于其他两个首领和剩余的机制。在战斗中，虎豹座狮最终会重新站起来，而且会恢复全部的健康值！（如果你没有疯狂的伤害）。这里是虎豹座狮最重要的机制。他会让一个玩家感到恐惧，这是100%无法打断的！一旦恐惧结束，虎豹座狮会跳到玩家现在的位置并开始咬他们。虎豹座狮必须被立即打断，否则玩家会死！坦克可以在短时间内存活，但 dps 或治疗者会在不到两秒钟内死亡。一旦打断，再次集中攻击他，并使他坐下。反复这个过程。

如果森切仍然存活，就击杀它；如果它感到害怕，就打断它。这就是全部。一定要时刻留意这个机制。

* **Guar** :  这个首领并不是特别威胁，如果你愿意可以避开它，但是为了让事情变得更容易，建议在你消灭老虎后再来对付它。它会向地面喷洒有毒区域攻击，你必须去闪避。坦克应该时刻将其嘲讽，一旦它的生命值降到0%，就像老虎一样会坐下一段时间，然后复活进入下一轮战斗。每次它起来时都要再打倒它。

* **熊** :  这非常简单，比看起来容易得多。熊是你的主要目标。一旦其他两个坐下来，集中攻击它，并在留在它的面前的同时尽可能多地造成伤害。它会偶尔获得一个伤害护盾，你必须尽可能地削弱它，同时也会进行一次恶心的锥形AOE重击。坦克可以阻挡这个攻击，但是DPS/治疗必须避让。基本上，此时堆叠并烧毁，除非其他附加怪物醒来或狗进来！狗/狼是必不可少的，接下来...

* **炸裂的狼** :  这个机制非常重要！在战斗中，3只狗/狼会慢慢地向团队移动，并专注于任何一个玩家，有时是多个。如果这些狗接近一个玩家，它们就会<b>爆炸</b>！要<b>保持在一起</b>！

你有两个选择（这就是我们保持远离的原因，这样可以给你更多时间来协调）。

攻略翻译如下：
第一种方法是一起决定绕老板和坦克的紧密圆圈中移动（顺时针或逆时针），而不要分散！同时保持你的点数。一起在移动时保持伤害输出，它们会因为伤害或者落到中央坦克头顶上而爆炸。

另一种选择是让整个队伍尽可能远离，集中攻击boss，而TANK则背对着迎面而来的狗。当它们靠近时，确保TANK基本上走向它们，它们会爆炸死亡。其中，TANK代表坦克职业，boss代表首领。

不管你决定使用哪种策略，但TANK必须进行格挡，否则狗会先秒杀他们。它们造成的伤害非常巨大，一个DPS/治疗者不像一个TANK那样能活下来。轰隆 = 死亡！





### 卡鲁里昂

> CALUURION


** 卡鲁里昂 **

这个比较简单，但是烟火和闪闪发光的灯光让这看起来像地狱。他是一个普通的巫妖首领，并加入了一些额外的机制。坦克应始终保持嘲讽，而团队则应围成一个漂亮的圆圈，准备应付下一个来袭的机制。 

其中包括专有名词Za（扎）、Uur（乌尔）、Harn（哈恩）、Ghost（鬼魂）、Orryn the Black（乌黑者奥瑞恩）、Time Stop（时间静止）、Clever（聪慧者）、Uppercut（升天击）、Caluurion（卡鲁里昂）、Sabina Cedus（萨拜娜·塞杜斯）、Spirit（灵魂）、Ri（里）、Ghost（幽灵）、Dragon（龙）、Body（尸体）、Lizabet Charnis（莉扎贝特·查尼斯）、Bloodroot Forge（血根熔炉）、Skeleton（骷髅）、Un（乌恩）、Ulfnor（乌尔夫诺尔）、Sabina（萨拜娜）。

* **巫妖水晶** :  如果你曾经面对过巫妖，那么这个机制对你来说应该非常熟悉。大型范围伤害圆圈将出现在地面上，由内部指示器扩散，当它们达到顶峰时，它们将发射水晶并爆炸。这个机制非常简单……不要四处乱跑。只需找到一个间隙，站在里面就行了。不要让它碰到你，就这样。如果它碰到了你，会造成非常强的伤害并晕眩你。

* **泼溅攻击** :  BOSS会在地面上发射多个泼溅效果。与巫妖水晶有阵型效果不同，这些攻击实际上会落在地面上并在撞击时造成伤害。当你看到这些攻击时，只需轻微移动站在安全的地方，不要像一只无头鸡一样乱跑。只需踏出阵型即可躲避攻击，盲目跑圈是没有用的。控制好自己！

* **上古卷轴在线游戏攻略

图腾** :  在战斗过程中，首领会激活房间内的图腾，它们会对小队造成不同类型的伤害，并召唤不同的小怪。当你看到图腾亮起来时，你必须和小队一起移动，把它们围成一个好看的圆圈并把它击败。 

其中专有名词翻译如下：

Za => 扎  
Uur => 乌尔  
Harn => 哈恩  
Ghost => 鬼魂  
Orryn the Black => 乌黑者奥瑞恩  
Time Stop => 时间静止  
Clever => 聪慧者  
Uppercut => 升天击  
Caluurion => 卡鲁里昂  
Sabina Cedus => 萨拜娜·塞杜斯  
Spirit => 灵魂  
Ri => 里  
Dragon => 龙  
Body => 尸体  
Lizabet Charnis => 莉扎贝特·查尼斯  
Bloodroot Forge => 血根熔炉  
Skeleton => 骷髅  
Un => 乌恩  
Ulfnor => 乌尔夫诺尔  
Sabina => 萨拜娜

骷髅会出现并需要被消灭。当它们被消灭时，它们会爆炸！现在，这个技巧是在图腾上杀死它们，因为它们的爆炸会对图腾造成额外的伤害。一旦它们被消灭，回到Boss和你的队形。

注意，在这个阶段，你可能会受到多个附加在你身上的区域效果（每个人都会有一个），这取决于生成的图腾类型。不要与你的朋友重叠这些区域圆圈，给彼此留下空间。此阶段仍适用于boss的所有其他机制（是的，包括巫妖水晶）。

* **根** :  根据目前所出现的图腾，你可能偶尔会被藤蔓缠住并根深蒂固（Lurcher totem），如果这种情况发生了，你必须执行闪避来摆脱，避免在它爆炸之前受到高伤害的打击。

* **蛇** :  其中一个图腾也会释放小蛇和一条大蛇。群体伤害可以杀死它们，但坦克控制它们会更有帮助。

* **NUKE IT** :  放核弹?! 在这个问题上你要不要选择使用核弹？如果你队伍的DPS非常高，你可以很快地将Boss打到血量很低的情况，可以说有可能跳过一些机制。但是开发人员对此进行了预料，因此为了防止这种情况发生，如果你不去攻击图腾直接去减少Caluurion的血量，在25%时Caluurion将对所有伤害免疫，并且在你至少去除一个图腾之前完全无法受到伤害。所以，请注意，即使你是一个骷髅傀儡粉碎者，你也不能完全避免所有的机制问题，在这场战斗中，机制非常重要。 ;)





### 乌尔夫诺尔

> ULFNOR


**乌尔夫诺尔和萨拜娜·塞杜斯**

这位首领的战斗相当具有机动性，取决于你的团队的伤害和在机制期间聚焦的能力。有一些令人讨厌几乎是秒杀的机制，以及一个明确的一击必杀机制，这些必须非常注意。即使首领的生命值相对较低，他的机制也能够消灭甚至最强大的团队。坦克需要始终保持嘲讽，这是理所当然的。尽可能保持首领不动，并且不要与首领跳舞。

* **恐惧** :  这个Boss会使他身边的幽灵在随机方向上让一个玩家感到恐惧，尽快用破解技能摆脱它，以便避免任何后续机制。魔法DPS玩家需要注意他们的耐力维持，因为在这场战斗中像疯子一样地奔跑，如果你不能在需要时自由移动，则会导致你死亡。

* **重击** :  首领将蓄力一个巨大的重击，如果坦克不格挡将会秒杀。这个必须由坦克承受且必须格挡，否则将会死亡。如果因为某些原因这个攻击放在了DPS身上，他们必须闪避躲开，否则也会死亡（你作为一个脆皮无法格挡这个攻击）。

* **火焰之剑** :  这个攻击的动画与之前的重击非常相似，通常在重击之后执行，但这次剑会着火！当这种情况发生时，在撞击时boss会释放3个非常快速移动的中等大小的火焰AoE，分别朝着3个不同方向。作为DPS或治疗者，当您看到这种动画时，您需要稍微后退一点，做好准备，并尝试站在您能看到的缝隙中避免它。请注意，它们可能会反弹到墙上并返回，因此请注意您的脚步，坦克必须观察boss的位置。

* **外星入侵** :  上次我在“血根熔炉”中也这样描述了一个机制。基本上，首领会站在原地开始释放技能。该技能会迅速向玩家的方向发射许多小小的火焰AOE。就像外星入侵避免受到伤害，当它们飞向你时，左右蠕动以避免危险。一两个会让你受重伤，3个或以上会让你死亡！所以当你看到他在释放技能时，要分散开来！大喊“外星入侵”，然后摆动身体避免受伤！

* **死亡之链** :  在战斗中，首领会多次让灵魂飞到房间的另一侧，幽灵会用链子抓住一个玩家的脚，慢慢地将他们拖过房间。你必须马上注意到这种机制，团队需要在首领靠近他们之前杀死幽灵。如果他们不能在时间内将其击杀，首领就会慢慢走向他们并最终用剑直接刺穿他们，造成致命一击。你无法生存下去。

当BOSS血量降至最低，他将会进行一次终极攻击——一个巨大的升天击。这个攻击总是瞄准坦克，如果你没有在BOSS到达坦克前击败他，那么坦克将会被一击必杀，而BOSS将会一直在场上游荡直到你击败他。在这个时候一定要集中火力攻击BOSS，治疗并不能帮助坦克，一定要击败BOSS！

注意：如果首领在房间中央，坦克将会被升天击飞到房间的另一侧，让你的小队有足够的时间杀死首领（他行动缓慢）。然而，如果坦克没有留意位置，把首领引导到角落里，坦克从升天击中恢复后的路程就会很短，因为首领离坦克太近了，坦克实际上会在几秒钟内死亡。所以，在他剩下的健康值很少时，一定要让坦克把这个家伙放在中间！





### 图尔佛昆

> THURVOKUN


**苏沃库恩和乌黑者奥瑞恩**

这很可能是迄今为止最难的困难模式。你所学到的一切都将发挥作用，甚至还要更多。如果你不了解基本的机制（如控制、格挡、打断），那么你现在需要熟悉它们，因为每个机制都将被使用。这需要大量的练习和大量的协调，而且这绝不是一个DPS比赛。你越快，难度就越大，因为你可能会无意中被压倒并不可避免地死亡。有时候，拖时间越长，越好。要有节奏！

注意，龙不是你的首要目标！所以立即将“我们必须快速杀死龙”的想法从你的脑海中排除。机制才是老大，而不是房间中央那个可恶的大骨头东西。它可以在你喜欢的任何时候死去，没有什么匆忙要求。

这个“坦克”角色绝不能放弃嘲讽技能，而且尽可能让龙保持在房间中央，无论当时的机制如何。

队伍编排非常重要，坦克的角色在下面有说明，但是你的队伍需要有自己的位置，以避免机制的攻击。给每个输出和治疗角色分配一个水晶，并将门分配给“gate”（门）角色。因此，每个人的水晶都有一个玩家名称，门则有独立名称。这将准确地提供机制攻击的位置。这非常重要。在战斗的最初阶段，你的输出和治疗角色需要始终靠近他们的位置，除非必须移动，如果他们确实需要移动，他们必须快速回到他们的位置。这是一个非常大的房间，所以要好好掌握你的体力，你不希望体力耗尽。

* **毒药扩散** :  上司将在坦克（或谁有仇恨）身下放下一个小的毒药aoe，它会不断增大，直到达到最大大小，然后消失。不要站在里面，它会迅速地杀死你。诀窍在于放置。AOE被放置在你可以走出它的位置并让它自行解决的地方。当它即将结束时，BOSS会放置另一个并在整场战斗中重复这个过程。

看着地面，房间中间堆满了骨头。把它当做你的指南。选择其中一个角落。当区域效果技能放在你的脚下时，移动（即使要通过龙来规划翻滚）到地面骨头的另一侧（想象它是一个正方形，你只是从一角到另一角）。当下一个区域效果技能放在你的新位置上时，旧的那个就会消失……所以回到原来的位置……重复重复重复。这将为你提供充足的时间，并大大控制毒药实际着陆的位置。

不要像一只无头鸡一样在房间里乱跑，恐慌地想着它应该放在哪里，因为你会把它放在可怕的地方，让团队中的其他成员不堪重负。

* **奥瑞恩的远程攻击** :  奥瑞恩是首领，而不是龙，我必须清楚地说明这一点！作为一组，你们必须时刻关注他！他会传送到房间里，身上有一个浅蓝色的光环跟着他，这样当他从一个位置到另一个位置移动时，你们可以稍微容易地找到他，即使他在高处准备再次落下。所以，利用这个知识来跟踪他。最重要的是，你们每个人都有特定的位置，就是为了覆盖尽可能多的地面，以应对这个机制！这是战斗第一阶段最重要的机制。当他传送到地面上时，他将会在房间的一个角落，这时你们要喊出一个玩家的名字（或者传送门），让团队知道他在哪里着陆了。一旦确定了位置，他必须尽快被打断！他有一种讨厌的快速脉冲单体攻击，会打击所有玩家。大约三次攻击会杀死任何输出或治疗人员。

攻略翻译如下：
如果治疗师可以使用破碎冲击进行打断（即使需要坦克），以帮助进行远距离打断，将会很有帮助，但这并非必需的。重要的是，必须不惜一切代价，每次首领执行此技能时都要打断他。

如果你要打断他，请让你的小组知道，这样当他失控时，他们可以闪避他的任何攻击。你可以闪避攻击，但是这非常冒险，且消耗资源较高，因此尽快打断更好。

请务必注意站位，如果你需要移动来攻击敌人，在攻击完毕后要回到原来的站位。团队协作是关键，不要一个人冲锋陷阵。在这里，团队协调是最重要的。你们是一个团队，不要一个人闯荡。

战斗期间每隔几秒钟会发生这个机制，直到所有水晶都被击败（出现）。因此请注意。无论你在进行什么机制，都必须将其视为重点。

* **重击** :  首领会向获得仇恨的人释放一个重击。这个人应该始终是坦克。现在坦克可以用格挡来抵挡攻击，但同时一旦攻击到达2倍，两个Shalks会在坦克的位置下方产生。因此，如果你闪避此攻击，有助于消除下一个说明中出现的任何负面效果。重击会散发出一个小的范围伤害。如果你在峰值时闪避，你就可以避免受到伤害，但Shalks仍然会产生。

* **Elder Scrolls Online攻略

Shalks** :  这是每个坦克的噩梦...减速！没有什么比在关键位置无法快速跑动更糟糕的了。所以你需要做的是：如果你被它们的攻击抓住，你就会被一种剧烈的减速效果和持续10秒的有毒效果所纠缠。这不仅仅是靠近Shalks，还要在它们前面。

这个技巧就是控制和击杀。

无论你使用哪个职业，只要你有控制敌人的根/晕眩技能，并远离它们（不要过度操纵地上的毒液），你就可以成功。任何一个人站在沙尔克的前面都会受到伤害和减速，所以小心脚底下！无论组合如何，最理想的方法是在你的团队中有人运行“时间静止”。每当boss即将进行重击时，如果在坦克所在的位置施放时间静止，他们将被昏迷几秒钟，并死于基于地面的AOE。

注意：地面AOE必须始终位于BOSS下方（基本上准备好Shalks）的位置。

当夏克活着时，不要集火首领。确保让点数造成被动伤害，但要专注于击败夏克并帮助坦克控制房间。

* **冰尾抽打** :  这个BOSS会在战斗中朝他选择的方向发射三个大型三角形的冰AOE。很容易避开，只要站在空隙中或者阻挡一下就可以了。如果你被打中但没有阻挡，将会被击退并且受到高伤害。

* **水晶和骨巨像** :  这取决于剩余血量的百分比，但所选的水晶是随机的（85％，75％，65％，55％）。这就是为什么你不需要把首领打败。熟悉其他机制，慢慢来。你越快推进，水晶阶段就越快发生，你可能会意外重叠它们，你绝对不想发生这种情况！

奥瑞恩将前往一个水晶，你不能打它。你必须尽快杀死水晶！与此同时，会出现一些小的附加怪物（通常只需使用一些范围伤害就能处理），以及一个庞大的骨骼巨像。这不是坦克的优先任务。作为治疗和输出者，你需要知道如何处理它们。

一旦你看到奥瑞恩前往水晶，你的小组领袖应该喊出他在哪个水晶旁边（这是属于那一方的玩家名字或“门”的名字）。要清晰明确。当这种情况发生时，除了坦克之外的所有玩家都需要尽快赶到那里，紧密堆叠在一起并且避免AOE攻击，攻击水晶。

如果骨魔像试图对其中一名玩家进行重型攻击，玩家必须进行闪避来避免受到大约96k的伤害，不要使用格挡，否则你会死的很惨。所以要控制好你的体力并做好准备闪避。重型攻击有个延迟，所以等到它的手高高举起，在它落下之前闪避。如果你看到了重型攻击的火花，就数数三二一大喊着闪避。如果你太早了就会死，如果你太晚了也同样会死。这需要不断地练习。

首先，必须优先击败骨巨像（紧贴水晶以防它逃跑并攻击远处的人）。如果水晶没有被迅速摧毁，那么另一个骨巨像将从同一地点重生。

这些水晶是你想使用终极技能的地方。因此，如果你认为你无法在水晶之间建立终极技能，只需减少对龙造成的伤害，并有意识地建立终极技能，无论花费多长时间，都不需要着急。

一旦水晶被摧毁，所有人必须立即回到原来的位置。在此阶段，必须密切关注奥瑞恩，因为他可能会到房间中的任意位置并需要中断。在一个地方停留过久可能会使处理这种机制变得难以处理，因此您必须注意在此阶段可能会发生这种情况。

因此，召唤水晶玩家的名字（或者门）快速获得它和巨像的控制权，然后回到原来的位置。

这需要练习和协调！

* **鬼魂第一阶段和巫妖水晶** :  在45%的时候，你和你的小组需要离开他们的位置，远离墙壁，并注意小组领导的指示。奥瑞恩将随机传送到一个位置（点名或'大门'以确定他的当前位置）。当你发现他时，你会看到他召唤一堵巨大的鬼墙，它们会直接向你冲过来。你不能格挡、清除、腐蚀护甲、治疗或者做任何事情，这些都会在接触时杀死你。

然而这就是一个新机制的发挥所在。一直在地牢中帮助你的金色鬼魂将会出现。他会跑到他选择的房间位置，并且挡起了一面金色的保护墙。你和你的队伍需要躲在保护墙后面，以免被鬼魂伤害到。

协调方法是，一旦你们注意到boss从哪个方向来，就一起退到房间的最远处（坦克控制龙，时间静止控制Shalks，把伤害留在地面上！（是的有很多要做的事）... 让你的团队朝着boss的方向看去...

当你的相机位于这种位置时，寻找黄金人并喊出“左边”、“右边”或“中间”来告诉你的团队他的位置，这样你们就可以作为一个整体移动并保护自己。

每次鬼魂都消失后，靠近房间中央，远离墙壁，准备下一轮的刷怪。再次重申Orryn的位置或传送门位置，转动相机指向他的方向，可以确定保护墙的位置。反复执行，直到BOSS掉血到5%以下，此时他将停止这个机制，并前往房间中心进行最终战斗！

注1：在这场战斗中，2个巨魔水晶会一遍又一遍地生成，你必须避开它们。这是一个非常需要移动的战斗，不要浪费资源来闪避。只需将你的脚放在它们外面，或者如果你不走运，防御！

注意事项2：如果你是坦克，请记住，任何站在Shalks前面的人都会被减速并受到毒性打击。作为一个团队或者坦克，你可以站在金色墙壁的后面，远离危险区域。你不必贴着墙，只要站在一条直线上，就是安全的。所以如果你需要把BOSS拉远一点，就这么做。

* **奥瑞恩** :  一旦龙快死了，奥瑞恩就会接管龙的身体，首领的生命值会回到50％！现在事情变得非常疯狂！始终保持点在身上，持续控制和集中火力攻击Shalk，安全放置毒药，避免冰尾鞭击，避免Lich的水晶，最重要的是不要惊慌。

你和你的小组现在需要更好的协调！远离墙壁，否则你会死！记得注意谁是哪一方！你需要这些呼叫！

* **幽灵第二阶段** :  在这里，人们会一遍又一遍被清空，因为他们试图过于聪明和/或惊慌失措！

鬼魂会像之前一样，从分配给你的一侧或大门出现（可以像以前一样称这些玩家分配的一侧或大门），但是没有金色的家伙来帮助你，也没有墙来保护你！

相反，鬼魂之间会随机出现空隙。首先需要有人喊出鬼魂的出现位置，并且有人喊出空隙的位置，让人们知道在哪里是安全的。如果有任何一个鬼魂碰到你，你就一定会死亡！

这个攻略的关键是利用空间。要尽可能在中心附近留出足够的空间给你时间去寻找鬼魂和间隙。一旦这个空间已经确认好了，立刻朝间隙冲过去！你越快通过间隙，就越快能够转身重新集中注意力于首领/酸性白茧/机制上。

如果你等到最后一秒才让鬼魂们接近你，那你就有很大的风险，因为他们可能会重新生成在你当前所处的位置，导致你死亡。充分利用你的空间和时间！

**骷髅增援！**——直到战斗结束，骷髅将不断从曾经有水晶的地方生成。它们必须被消灭，但它们的生命值不是很高。它们会进行重击，但可以被格挡。它们会进行定身攻击，需要使用躲避翻滚来摆脱（这对资源来说是个痛苦，所以最好杀了它们而不是让它们这样做！）。

攻略翻译如下：
这个技巧就是记住，你应该始终放置圆点 (指技能) 处理Boss元素和Shalks...只要你不在房间里狂奔，骷髅就会在范围效果中死亡。而且你使用的时间静止技能将允许你同时冻结这些骷髅和Shalks。慢慢来，不要惊慌！

* **死亡气息** :  每隔三波鬼魂（有时候是两波半）首领会让全队进入恐惧状态，让他们随机朝不同的方向奔跑，这种状态无法被打破。此时，龙会离开房间，攀爬到高墙上，开始施放一个巨大的直接攻击。

当这种情况发生时，房间内会随机出现 4 个金色圆圈在不同位置。每个组员脚下会有一个扩散的范围伤害。如果你无法在范围伤害满前（即接近死亡的气息）到达金色圆圈并捡起它（每人一个），你会被攻击打中并一击必杀。如果你捡起了金色圆圈，你就会存活下来。你不需要格挡，需要同时应对机制，捡起金色圆圈，并且执行要快，不要犹豫。

还有一个小提示。每当鬼魂进入第三阶段，恐惧开始时，分散开！这样做的原因是，如果你在中间挤在一起，很可能会被恐惧影响，落入毒区而死亡！

* **骨石巨像** :  除了已经需要应对的一大堆麻烦之外，每当首领血量下降10％，你就会遭遇一只骨石巨像！没错，你烧掉首领的速度越快，收获的骨石巨像就越多！40％、30％、20％和10％时各一只。你必须快速杀死它并集中火力攻击。记住，如果它发动重击，你就得翻滚躲避，否则就会死亡。

这个机制非常重要，但因为它是基于百分比而非计时的，你可以在每10%中花费你想要的时间。实际上，如果你对机制感到很舒服，只需保持活着，躲避鬼魂等等，在每10%中你可以积攒终极技能，以便更快地杀死巨像。

最后说明：

首先，这场战斗非常疯狂，同时进行许多机制，您将不得不逐渐理解，然后才能做到。这是游戏中最具挑战性的4人副本之一。与一些朋友一起练习和学习，并保持在同一小队中。此外，一个重要的因素是......你不需要50k +的DPS，事实上，较少的DPS有时更好，因为你不会在准备好之前强制执行机制！

练习、协调、保持打断、保持位置和清晰的呼救声，你就能完成这个任务。

装备选择：用于练习。如果您遇到困难，所有的魔法用户都可以装备凤凰套装，坦克/体力输出可以装备永恒的约基达（对于体力建议将珠宝的特性更改为稳健x2和1个嗜血，取决于建筑类型）。这将允许您在需要时享有一次免费重生！

祝你们好运！

> 
> This boss is actually multiple waves of adds controlled by the boss herself. Anyone that has dealt with large trash packs/pulls/mobs should be able to manage this. Make sure you are all centered in the middle of the room. Get the tank to agro as much as possible while you stay in the heals and damage. Chains/cc pulling will be required for this fight. Do not panic and do not run around else it can be a mess. The trick to this is keeping up as much aoe damage as possible to deal with all the tiny adds while dealing with the big ones.
> 
> **Ghosts** - The boss will spawn wraiths per phase and they will spawn on the outside of the room (quite far out) they will fire nasty high damage ice light attacks and also a fast moving ground based ice cloud. THIS must be avoided as a dps and/or healer. They will immobilize and hit for HIGH damage. As soon as these are in the room be sure that your tank pulls them into the center as soon as possible so they can be killed quick!
> 
> **Bone Colossus**  - During each wave there will be a bone colossus. These hit pretty hard and should be controlled by the tank but focused down by the dps as soon as possible. These have a nasty spreading aoe that BURSTS when it hits maximum radius causing high damage and knock down. You can block the damage to this but still get knocked down, or you can simply dodge roll/run out of the aoe.
> 
> NOTE: the last wave there are x2 of these, you should really save your ultimates for this phase.
>

> 
> ** CADAVEROUS BEAR **
> 
> This fight is the PUG killer! This fight will make or break your group! You will need to co-ordinate and STICK to your plan. If one person tries to be a hero this is ALL over! The tank should grab all three enemies and hold them together. You want to hold these as FAR away from the 3x wolves/dogs as possible so they have a longer journey to make. The reason for this is timing. More time to react and prepare for their entrance to the fight.
> 
> **Tiger Senche** - This is the biggest problem in the room. You should focus the Senche down as soon as possible and he will be pinned to the ground for a period of time. He can be taunted but will occasionally hit whoever he likes so do NOT run away, he doesn't hit particularly hard but you need to keep it close to the other bosses and focus it down. Once it is sitting down you can focus on the other two and remaining mechanics. During the fight the Senche will eventually get back up and be full health again! (if you do not have crazy damage). Here is the most important mechanic for the Senche. He will FEAR one player, which is 100% UNBREAKABLE! Once the fear is over the Senche will jump onto the player at their now current position and start chewing on them. The Senche MUST be interrupted instantly or the player will die! A tank can survive for a short period of time but a dps or healer will die in less than two seconds flat. Once interrupted, focus him again and make him sit down as before. Rinse repeat.
> 
> If the Senche is alive kill it, if it fears interrupt it. That's it. ALWAYS keep your eyes open for this mechanic.
> 
> **Guar** - This boss is not really a huge threat and can be avoided if you choose but to make things easier, kill it, AFTER the Senche. It spits poison aoes onto the ground that you must avoid. The tank should taunt this at all times and once it is 0% health , just like the Senche it will sit down for a time and then revive for another round. Simply put it down every time it gets up.
> 
> **BEAR!** - This is very simple and a lot easier than he looks. The bear is your main target. Focus it down once the other two are sitting down and do as much damage as you can while staying out of of his face. He will occasionally get a damage shield which you pretty much just have to beat down and also will do a nasty cone aoe heavy attack. The tank can block this but the dps/healer must stay out of it. Basically a stack and burn at this point unless the other adds wake up or the dogs come in! Dogs/wolves are ESSENTIAL, coming next...
> 
> **Exploding Wolves!** - This mechanic is crucial! During the fight 3 dogs/wolves will slowly move towards the group and focus on any player of their choice, sometimes multiples. If these dogs reach a player they will EXPLODE!. STAY TOGETHER!!!
> 
> You have two options here (this is the reason we stay so far back, gives you more time to co-ordinate).
> 
> Method one is, decide which way you are all going to move in a circle TOGETHER, in a tight circle around the boss and tank(clockwise or counter clockwise) without spreading out!  while keeping your dots down. Keep the damage up while moving around together and they will blow up either via damage of on top of the tank in the middle.
> 
> The other option is to have your entire group stay as far back as possible focusing the boss while the TANK has their back to the incoming dogs. When they get close be sure that the tank basically walks into them and they will explode and die.
> 
> Either tactic you decide however the tank MUST be blocking, else the dogs will one shot them. They do MASSIVE damage and a dps/healer will NOT survive like a tank. Boom = dead!
> 
> 
> 
> CALUURION
> 
> 
> ** CALUURION **
> 
> This is pretty straight forward but all of the fireworks and shiny lights make this look like hell. He is a basic lich boss with a couple of extra mechanics worked in. The tank should keep it taunted at all times while the group make a nice circle around the boss ready to take on the next incoming mechanics.
> 
> **Lich Crystals** - If you have ever faced a Lich before this mechanic will be VERY familiar to you. Large aoe circles will appear on the ground which will spread from their inside indicators and when they reach peak they will emit a crystal and they will explode. This mechanic could NOT be any simpler...DON@T run around the room. Just find a gap, and stand in it. Don't let it touch you, that is all. If it does, it will hit VERY hard and stun you.
> 
> **Splashes** - The boss will fire multiple splash effects on the ground, unlike the Lich crystals which have a spreading aoe, these actually land on the ground and do damage on impact. When you see these coming, simply move a little to stand in safe places, do NOT run around like a headless chicken. A couple of steps out of the aoes will save you, running in circles will not. Control yourself!
> 
> **Totems** - During the fight the boss will awaken a totem in the room which will deal different types of damage to the group and also spawn different adds in the room to deal with. When you see a totem light up you must move together as a group, surround the totem in a nice circle and focus it down.
> 
> Skeletons will spawn and need to be killed. When they are killed they will explode! Now the trick to this is to kill them ON the totem because their explosion will do additional damage to the totem. Once they are down, get back to the boss and back to your formation.
> 
> NOTE during this phase you could take multiple aoe affects which are attached to YOU as a player (each person gets one) depending on the type of totem that spawns. DO NOT overlap these aoe circles with your friends, give each other space. All other mechanics from the boss still apply at this stage (yes including Lich crystals.
> 
> **Root** - Depending on the totem at the time, you may occasionally get rooted with vines (Lurcher totem) if this happens, you must dodge roll to break free from it before it explodes and hits you for HIGH damage.
> 
> **Snakes** - One of the totems will also release small snakes and one large one. Aoe along can kill these but it helps if the tank controls them.
> 
> **NUKE IT?!** - Nuke or not nuke?. IF you have incredibly high dps in your group you can get the boss down to low health VERY fast, it is possible to skip some of the mechanics so to speak, BUT this was anticipated by the developers, SO to prevent this, if you IGNORE totems and go straight for the 'burn' at 25% Caluurion will go IMMUNE to all damage and be completely invulnerable UNTIL you get rid of at least ONE totem. So, be aware that you cannot completely avoid ALL of the mechanics just because you are a skeleton dummy smasher, mechanics ARE important on this fight. ;)

> 
> This boss is quite a mobile fight in some respects depending on your group's damage and capability to focus during mechanics. There are some nasty almost one shot mechanics along side a DEFINITE one shot mechanic and these must be paid close attention to. Even though the boss is relatively low in terms of health, his mechanics can wipe even the strongest groups.The tank needs to hold a taunt at all times, which of course goes without saying. Hold the boss as still as possible and do NOT dance with the boss.
> 
> **Fear** - The boss will make the ghost with him cause fear in a random direction aimed at a player, break free as SOON as possible to be able to avoid any follow up mechanics. Magicka dps players need to pay attention to their stamina sustain because sprinting around like a loon in this fight will cause you to die if you cannot break free of maneuver when required.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss will wind up a HUGE heavy attack which will one shot a tank if they don't block it. This must be on the tank and they MUST block or they will die. If it is on a dps for whatever bad reason this happened, they will need to dodge roll it or die (you won't block this as a squishy).
> 
> **Flaming sword** - This attack is very similar animation wise as the previous heavy attack and is usually done AFTER it but the sword this time will be on FIRE! When this happens, upon impact the boss will emit 3 very fast moving, medium sized flaming aoes in 3 different directions. When you see this animation as a dps or healer you need to step back a bit, prepare for the attack and try to avoid it by standing in an gap you can see. NOTE these can bounce off walls and come back so watch your feet and the tank must watch positioning of the boss.
> 
> **Space Invaders!!** - This is the way i described a mechanic in Bloodroot Forge also. Basically the boss will stand still and start channeling an ability. This ability will rapidly fire many many small fire aoes in the direction of the players. Just like space invaders avoiding incoming damage, as they come flying at you, wiggle left and right to stay out of danger. One or two will hit you hard, 3+ will kill you! So when you see him channeling, spread out! Shout 'space invaders' and get your wiggle on!
> 
> **Chains of death!** - During the fight multiple times the boss will send the spirit to the other side of the room and the ghost will chain one players feet and slowly drag them across the room. You MUST notice this mechanic as soon as it happens and the group needs to KILL the ghost before the boss reaches them. If they don't kill it in time, the boss will slowly walk over to them and eventually stab the sword straight through them for a guaranteed one sot. You CANNOT survive this.
> 
> At the end of the fight when the boss is Low health he will do a FINAL one of these following a MASSIVE uppercut. This is ALWAYS aimed at the tank and if you do not kill the boss before he reaches the tank, the tank will die to a one shot and then the boss will remain loose until you kill him. ALWAYS focus at this point, heals will not help the tank, finish the boss!
> 
> NOTE: if the boss is in the middle of the room the tank will be uppercut miles across the room, giving your group plenty of time to kill the boss ( he walks slowly). IF however the tank didn't pay attention to positioning and tanks the boss in a corner, the tank will not have far to go from the uppercut and will actually die with in a couple of seconds because the boos is too close. SO, tank this guy in the MIDDLE when he is low health!

> This quite possibly to date the HARDEST hard mode available. Everything you have learnt so far is going to be relevant And some. If you do not have a grasp on basic mechanics (ie. cc, blocks, interrupts) then you need to familiarize yourself with them now because EVERYTHING will be used.This takes a lot of practice and massive co-ordination and no it is NOT a dps race. The faster you go the harder it gets because you can accidentally get overwhelmed and inevitably die. The longer it takes in some cases the better. Pace yourself!
> 
> Also note, the DRAGON is NOT your primary focus! So get that 'we must kill the dragon fast' stuff out of your head right away. The MECHANICS are the boss, not that bloody great bone thing in the middle of the room. He can die whenever you like, there is NO rush.
> 
> The tank must NEVER drop taunt, and must try to keep the dragon in the middle of the room as much as possible at all times regardless of mechanics at the time...
> 
> FORMATION! This is KEY, the tank role is explained below but your group need to have their OWN locations to stick to in and out of mechanics. Assign each dps and healer to ONE crystal EACH, and leave the gate assigned to just 'gate'. So each person's crystal has a player name and the gate is it's own name. This will allow you to accurately call location of mechanics. THIS is key. Throughout the first stages of the fight it is KEY that your dps and healers ALWAYS hug their positions unless they have to move and if they DO have to move, whichever mechanic they have just dealt with...get BACK into your positions FAST! This is a MASSIVE room, so pace your stamina, you do NOT want to run dry.
> 
> **Spreading poison!** - During the boss will drop a small poison aoe under the tank (or whoever has agro) and it will grow and grow and grow until it is max size then it will vanish. Do NOT stand in this, it will kill you RAPIDLY. Not the trick to this is PLACEMENT. The aoe is PLACED so you can move out of it and leave it to it's business. When it is almost over the boss will place another one and repeat this process throughout the fight.
> 
> Look at the ground. There are loads of bones piled in the middle of the room. Use this as your guide. Pick a corner of it. When the aoe is placed on YOUR feet, move (even dodge roll through the dragon to relocate) to the OPPOSITE side of the bones on the floor (imagine it is a square and you are just going from one corner to the other). When the next one is placed in your new location, the old one will have disappeared...SO go back to your original position... repeat repeat repeat. This will give you plenty of time and so much control of where the poison actually lands.
> 
> Do NOT run around the room like a headless chicken panicking about where it should land because you will place it in HORRIBLE places and overwhelm the other members of the group.
> 
> **Orryn's Ranged attack!** - ORRYN is the boss NOT the dragon, i cannot say that clearly enough! it is essential that you, as a group keep eyes on that guy at ALL times! He will teleport around the room with a light blue aura following him so you can spot him a little easier when he moves from position to position even when he is up high ready to come down again. So use this knowledge to keep track of him. Above all, the reason you all have specific positions is to cover as MUCH ground as possible for this ONE MECHANIC! This is the most essential mechanic for the first phase of the fight. When he teleports onto the GROUND, he will be at one of the corners of the room, so this is when you call out a player's name (or gate) to allow the group to know where he has landed. Once this has been established he MUST be interrupted as soon as possible! He has a nasty fast paced pulsing single target spammy attack which hits all players. About 3 hits will kill any dps or healer.
> 
> It helps if a healer can fit crushing shock for this for interrupts(or even the tank if required) in order to help with long ranged interrupts, but is not essential. What is essential is that at ALL costs, that boss is interrupted every single time he does this.
> 
> If you are on route to interrupt let your group know, so that they can dodge roll any incoming attacks from him while he is loose. You can dodge the hits but it is very risky and high on resource drain so the faster the interrupt the better.
> 
> Remember positioning is KEY, if you had to move to get him, get back to where you were after wards. No heroes! C-ordination is the most important thing here. You are a group, no yoloers :)
> 
> This mechanic happens every few seconds during the fight UNTIL all the crystals are down (coming up) so pay attention. No matter what mechanic you are in, this must be kept an eye on.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will fire a heavy attack at whoever has agro. This should ALWAYS be the tank. Now the tank can with stand the attack with a block BUT at the same time once it hits 2x Shalks will spawn under the location of the tank. So if you dodge roll this it helps to eliminate any negative effects coming up in the next explanation. The heavy will emit a small spreading aoe. If you dodge roll at it's PEAK you will avoid it. BUT the Shalks WILL still spawn.
> 
> **Shalks** - This is every tanks worst nightmare...SNARE! Nothing worse than a massive room where positioning is key and you cannot run/move fast. SO here is what you need to do. Firstly if you get caught by their attacks you will get snared to hell with a massive movement reduction speed and a nasty poison dot for 10 seconds. This is not specific on being NEAR the Shalks but being near and IN FRONT of them..
> 
> So the trick to this is CC and kill.
> 
> Regardless of class so long as you have a root/stun ability to control them and keep moving away from them (without over manipulating the poison on the ground too much) you will be fine. ANY one that stands in front of a shalk will take damage and be snared so watch your feet! The most optimal trick for this regardless of group composition is to have someone in your group running 'time stop'. Every time the boss is about to heavy attack if you put a time stop where the tank is, they will get stunned for a few seconds and will die to ground based aoe.
> 
> NOTE: GROUND aoe needs to be under the boss(basically ready for Shalks) at ALL times.
> 
> When the Shalks are alive you do NOT focus the boss. keep dots down for passive damage for sure, but FOCUS the Shalks and help the tank control the room.
> 
> **Ice Tail whip** - The boss launch a massive 3x triangulated ice aoes in the direction of his choice during the fight. This is very easy to avoid, all you have to do stand in the gaps OR block it if you get caught. If you get caught without blocking you will be knocked back and take HIGH damage.
> 
> **Crystals and bone Colossus!** - This is health % based but the chosen crystal is random (85% 75% 65% 55%). THIS is why you don't have to burn the boss. Get familiar with the other mechanics and take your time. The faster you push the sooner crystal phases will happen and you can accidentally overlap them , which believe me you do NOT want to happen!
> 
> Orryn will travel to a crystal and you can not hit it. You must kill the crystal as fast as possible! AND at the same time, small adds come out(which can be dealt with just with some aoe damage generally) AND a massive bone colossus. This is NOT the tank's priority. As healers and dps you need to know how to manage this.
> 
> SO, As soon as you have seen Orryn go to a crystal, your group lead should call WHICH crystal he is at (this is whichever player name belongs on that side OR 'gate'). Be clear. When this happens all players(excluding the tank need to get over there as fast as possible, hug up stack and burn while avoiding aoes and get the crystal down.
> 
> IF the bone colossus tries to heavy attack one of the players, they MUST dodge roll it or take 96kish damage to the face, do NOT block this, you will NOT live. So pace your stamina and be ready to dodge. Now, the heavy attack is delayed so wait until his hand is WAY up high and then dodge it before it lands...As soon as you see the sparks for the heavy attack count 3 2 1 dodge out loud. If you are early you will die, if you are late you will die. This WILL take practice.
> 
> Above all the bone colossus MUST be killed (stay close to the crystal so he doesn't run off agroing someone far away) but if the crystal is not killed fast enough then ANOTHER bone colossus will spawn from the same spot.
> 
> These crystals are where you want to be using your Ultimates. So if you don't think you can build up an ultimate between crystals, simply ease up on the damage on the dragon and BUILD ultimate on purpose, no matter how long it takes, there is NO rush.
> 
> As SOON as the crystal is down you MUST all get back to your original positions. During this phase Orryn needs to be kept an eye on because he can go to a random position in the room and require interrupting. Staying in one place too long together can result in it being incredibly difficult to deal with this mechanic so you MUST be aware this can happen during this phase.
> 
> So, call the crystal player name(or gate) get IT and the colossus down fast and then get back in position.
> 
> This will take practice and co-ordination!
> 
> **Ghosts Phase One and Lich Crystals!** - At 45% you and your group need to get OFF their locations AWAY from the walls and pay attention to the group leader's calls. Orryn will teleport to a random location (call player name or 'gate' to determine his current location. When you have spotted him you will see him summon a HUGE wall of ghosts and they will be coming straight for you. You cannot Block, purge, corrosive armour, heal or anything, these WILL kill you on touch.
> 
> However this is where a new mechanic takes place. The gold ghost guy who has been helping you all along throughout the dungeon will appear. He will run to a location in the room of HIS choice and put up a gold wall of protection. You and your group need to hide behind this in order to protect you from the ghosts.
> 
> The way to co-ordinate this is once you have noted which way the boss is coming from, step back to the furthest part of the room that you can together (while the tank is controlling the dragon and the time stops are keeping the Shalks at bay and the damage stays on the ground! (yes a lot going on here)...Get your group to LOOK in the direction of the boss...
> 
> Once your camera is positioned as such, look for the gold guy and call 'left', 'right', or 'middle' to let your group know his location so you can move together as a unit and protect yourselves.
> 
> Every time the ghosts have all gone, get close to the middle of the room AWAY from the walls and get ready for the next spawn. Again calling the player or gate location of Orryn, spin your camera in his direction can call where the protection wall is. Rinse repeat until the boss is at around 5% and under in which case he will stop this mechanic and go to the center of the room for the FINAL BATTLE!
> 
> NOTE1: During this fight 2x Lich crystals will spawn over and over and you will have to avoid them. This is a VERY mobile fight, don't waste resources dodge rolling. Simply position your feet out of them or if you get unlucky, BLOCK!
> 
> NOTE2: IF you are the tank remember that anyone caught in front of the Shalks will be snared and hit really hard by a nasty poison dot. As a group or the tank, you can still stand WAY WAY back behind the gold wall. You don't have to have your face against, it, so long as you are in line with it, you are safe. So if you need to take the boss back a bit, then do so.
> 
> **ORRYN!** - Once the dragon is pretty much dead Orryn Takes over the dragon's body and the health of the boss goes back up to 50%! NOW things get STUPID! Keep your dots down at all times, keep CCing and FOCUSING the Shalks, keep placing the poison safely, keep avoiding the ice tail whip, keep avoiding the lich crystals, and above all do NOT panic.
> 
> You and your group need to co-ordinate more than ever now! Stay AWAY from the walls or you are DEAD! and remember to note who's side is who's! You will need these call outs!
> 
> **Ghosts Phase Two!!!** - THIS is where people wipe over and over trying to be too clever and/or panicking!
> 
> The ghosts, Just like before, will come from one of your assigned sides or the gate (so call the player assigned side or the gate as before) but there is NO gold guy to help you and NO wall to protect you!
> 
> Instead there are RANDOM gaps in the ghosts. You will need to have someone call out where they are coming from first of all , AND have someone shout where the gap is for people to run to so they know where it is safe. If any ghost TOUCHES you, you are 100% dead guaranteed!
> 
> The trick to this is utilizing space. huge around the middle as much as possible to give you TIME to locate the ghosts, And the gap. Once this has been established, go straight for the gap asap! The sooner you get through the gap, the sooner you can spin around and focus back on the boss/Shalks/mechanics.
> 
> If you leave it to the very last second and let the ghosts come to you, you are at massive risk of them re-spawning where you currently are and you will die. Make use of your space and time!
> 
> **Skeleton adds!** - Constantly until the end of the fight skeletons will spawn from where the crystals once were. These must die, BUT they don't have a lot of health. They do heavy attack which can be blocked. The do root which needs to be dodge rolled to break free (this is a pain on resources so kill them rather than let them do this!).
> 
> The trick to this is remember, you should have dots down all all times to deal with the boss passively AND the Shalks...The skeletons will die to in aoe so long as you don't sprint around the room. AND the time stops you are using will allow you to freeze these at the same time as the Shalks...take your time, don't panic!
> 
> **Death Breath!** - Every Third ghost phase (technically sometimes 2 and a half) the boss will fear the group and make them run random directions which is NOT breakable. During this time the dragon will leave the room and climb up high on the wall channeling a huge direct attack.
> 
> When this happens 4x gold circles will appear randomly in the room in RANDOM locations. Every group member has a spreading aoe under their feet. IF you do not each reach a gold circle and pick it up (one each) before the aoe is full (incoming death breath) the attack will hit you and you will die to a one shot. If you pick up the gold circle you will live. You do NOT need to block. You need to manage mechanics, WHILE grabbing the gold circles and be fast about it. Do not hesitate.
> 
> Also a small tip. Every third phase of ghosts, when the fear is coming, SPREAD OUT! the reason for this is if you are hugging the middle there is a strong possibility (and this happens a lot) that you will be feared into the poison and die!.
> 
> **Bone Colossus!** - EVERY 10% as well as the sh*tstorm of stuff you have to already deal with, you will get a bone colossus! That's right, the faster you burn the boss the more you get! 40% 30% 20% 10% you will get one. You MUST kill this fast and focus it. Remember if it heavy attacks you, dodge roll it or die.
> 
> This mechanic is important but because it is % based and not timed, you can take as long as you want per 10%. In fact if you are COMFORTABLE with the mechanics just staying alive, dodging ghosts etc etc, every 10% you can build up ultimate ready for the colossus so it can die faster.
> 
> Final Note:
> 
> Above all this fight is CRAZY, many many mechanics going on at once that you will have to grow to understand bit by bit before this becomes doable and/or easier. It is one of the most challenging pieces of 4man content in the game. Get together with some friends, stick to the same group and practice and learn together. Also one MAJOR important factor...you don't need 50k+ dps for this, in fact having less is sometimes better because you don't force mechanics to happen before you are ready for it!
> 
> Practice, co-ordinate, keep on the interrupts, keep positions and clear call outs, and you WILL get this done.
> 
> Gear options: For practicing. IF you are having trouble, all magicka users can slot the Phoenix set, and tanks/stamina dps can slot Eternal Yokeda (for stam change the traits in jewellery to robustx2 and 1 bloodthirsty depending on build) This will allow you a free death as and when IF required!

> Good luck to you all!
