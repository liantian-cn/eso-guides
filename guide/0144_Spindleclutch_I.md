## 蛛丝之握洞穴 I

> Spindleclutch I




### 蛛丝眷属

> Spindlekin


**蛛丝眷属**攻略

这场战斗非常基本，符合绝大多数人对于一级的首领期望。它有一些基本的轻型攻击，大多数人应该能够承受，但如果他们被打中，DPS应该进行格挡，有一个需要格挡的重型攻击，然后还有一些基本的机制需要跟进。这是一场非常快速的战斗，坦克不应该在保持蜘蛛不动的同时遇到太多问题，而DPS应该站在它身后杀死它。

* **召唤蜘蛛** :  在整个战斗过程中，蛛丝眷属会召唤小蜘蛛来帮助它战斗，这些蜘蛛与您已经遇到的蜘蛛相同，血量较低，它们喷洒毒液覆盖前方区域和地面蜘蛛网区域，并会吞食死亡的目标。作为坦克，请确保将这些小蜘蛛拉到或堆叠在主战区域和BOSS周围。大多数AOE伤害应该能够杀死它们，但请务必在它们尝试恢复生命时打断它们。

* **吞噬** :  这个地牢里的蛛丝眷属和普通的蜘蛛非常相似，也可以吞噬地上的死敌来恢复生命值。这种恢复很显著，如果你的团队输出不高或经验不足，这就会很痛苦，为了避免这种情况发生，你必须尽快打断这个机制。基本上你要寻找一个视觉效果，它看起来像是在“吃”一只死掉的蜘蛛。如果你能做到这一点，那么这个Boss就不会成为问题。





### 蛛群之母

> Swarm Mother


** 蛛群之母 **

这个Boss与上一个非常相似，仍然是一只大蜘蛛，它具有轻重攻击，但如果控制不好，比上一个Boss更加移动。重要的是，DPS和治疗者需要站在Boss的后面并靠近它，坦克需要专注于传送额外的蜘蛛(或者从远处嘲讽)，使它们同时集中攻击Boss，并确保Boss保持尽可能稳定且背对团队。注意：不要在房间里乱跑，这只会让情况混乱，最终你会死掉。

* **召唤蜘蛛** :  和上一个Boss一样，这个Boss也会在整个战斗过程中召唤蜘蛛，需要让坦克嘲讽它们和/或用链条把它们钉住，不要让Boss在房间里乱跑。它们可以很快地被AOE伤害杀死，但一定要确保你的小组观察任何试图从死尸上获取能量/治疗的蜘蛛。如果你发现它们在这样做，就打断它们。还要避免接触它们的毒液/蛛网AOE攻击。

* **重击** :  蛛群之母偶尔会站起来用后腿对坦克或者被攻击目标发动强力的重击，你必须格挡。注：Swarm Mother为一BOSS，指的是此Boss的攻击方式。

**Leap**——她会偶尔跳向一个随机目标，狠狠地打击并将其击倒。保持在一起，靠近在一起，你们就会没事。不过，如果她跳向你，请阻挡或闪避，不要逃走！一旦结束，尽可能靠近。团队需要靠紧，否则她会持续造成范围伤害。





### 寡妇制造者瑟瑞斯

> Cerise the Widow-Maker


** 寡妇制造者瑟瑞斯 **

这个BOSS很棘手，她并不是特别难，但是房间里有很多额外的敌人。坦克应该尽快抓住近战敌人，然后在抓住BOSS的同时开始锁定远程目标。 DPS应该能够很快地Aoe下敌人，但应该专注于治愈师和法师，他们攻击非常强大，有时必须打断他们的引导能力。不要站在地上的圆圈里，这里的火焰伤害相当恶心。

* **乱舞** :  虽然它不是严格意义上的乱舞，但她确实有一种乱舞式攻击，通过快速的轻攻击瞄准坦克或掌握仇恨的人员，这并不是很强，但如果它针对你，请强烈建议进行格挡，特别是由于进攻的伤害结合在一起可能会产生问题。

* **重击** :  一种直接的重击攻击，与视觉上的任何其他重击攻击没有区别，当攻击方式变化时请务必准备好格挡。如果坦克没有格挡，她不会杀死坦克，但她可以消灭一个更弱的DPS，所以要小心。一定要格挡重击攻击。再次强调，不要逃走。

* **定身** :  她会释放一个持续施法的能力，在完成后会使目标昏迷/定身，通常是针对坦克，你可以摆脱它，但你也可以在她施法之前打断。保持警觉，阻止她做这件事。





### 大拉布

> Big Rabbu


** 大拉布 **

这个Boss很简单，但有一个恶毒的攻击方式会让你失算。首先，坦克需要抓住Boss的仇恨，你不希望他攻击DPS或治疗。接下来，在Boss的仇恨之下，尽量抓住越多的敌人，将其集中在战斗的中心，同时在远程和治疗类型的敌人身上进行中断，以防止治疗和过多的地板伤害。对于DPS，尽可能多地进行AOE伤害，稀释敌人数量，然后最终击败Boss。不要在圈子里乱转，需要时进行格挡和中断。奔跑会致命。

* **夹持** :  就像龙骑士的连锁能力一样，大拉布也可以把玩家连接在一起。他会链住你，然后用轻攻来射击，所以如果他把你拉近了，请格挡，躲开，然后继续击打他的侧面/背部。

* **冲锋** :  这个能力十分容易被发现并躲避，但仍有人会出错。一个危险的宽条型范围技能将出现在地板上，标记他即将经过的路径。如果你被困住了，有两个选择，挡格或稍快速度脱离开范围。如果你两个都不做且不是坦克，他将撞倒并杀死你。小心！





### 低语者

> The Whisperer


**低语者** 攻略

在蛛丝洞穴的最终BOSS有点挑战，她是一个庞大的蜘蛛，可以说是以梅菲拉为形象的，并且看起来非常可怕。房间里一开始就充满了敌人。一定要将所有敌人拉到门口，确保它们堆叠在一起以受到范围伤害，并打断治疗者和远程攻击。不要跑到房间的中心，因为这样会在你准备好之前就引来BOSS。

当所有敌人都被消灭后，坦克需要把BOSS放在任何能看到她的位置（中间位置是比较好的选择），并且保持尽可能的静止，使其背对团队。

输出和治疗应该始终站在三角形的形状中，准备注意来自机制的攻击。不要堆在一起，你们必须有自己的空间，否则这将变得非常棘手。

* **穿刺** :  这是一个很基本的近战攻击，只会攻击当前有仇恨的目标，通常是坦克，如果你有足够的抗性和生命，可以格挡和减轻伤害。

* **蛛网牵引** :  一种类似链条的机制，她会把玩家拉到她站着的中心位置并造成非常短暂的眩晕效果，需要注意这一点，因为当这种情况发生时，她通常会接着使用“迪德拉炸弹”（接下来会介绍）。 

**Daedric Explosion** - Cerise will cast a large frontal cone AOE attack, this needs to be avoided by all players and should be announced preferably to maximize everyone's chances of avoiding it.

**迪德拉炸弹** - 瑟瑞斯将释放一个大型前锋锥形范围攻击，所有玩家都需要避开它，最好宣布以最大化每个人避开攻击的机会。

**Web Spray** - Cerise will spin and shoot out webs in all directions that will tether players to the ground, players can move but they will take gradual damage while tethered, to break the tether you must heavy attack the web, if you don't break the tether in time it will do a burst of damage to you, you can avoid the tether by breaking line of sight with Cerise during the web cast.

**蛛网喷射** - 瑟瑞斯会旋转并朝所有方向射出蛛网，将玩家拴在地上，玩家可以移动，但当受到拴绳束缚的时候将逐渐受到伤害，要打破这种束缚，你必须猛烈攻击蛛网，如果你没有及时打破束缚，它将对你造成一次突发伤害，你可以在蛛网释放过程中通过遮蔽和瑟瑞斯的视线来避免被拴住。

**Egg Laying** - Cerise will lay spider eggs throughout the room and while they sit they will spawn **Swarm Spiders**. These eggs need to be destroyed as soon as possible, as these little buggers take up a lot of space and while alive, can cause quite the headache.

**产卵** -瑟瑞斯会在房间里放置蜘蛛卵，当它们孵化后，它们会产生蜘蛛群。这些卵需要尽快摧毁，因为这些小虫占据了很多空间，而且在活着的时候会带来很多麻烦。 

**Ak's Poison Cloud** - Ak will release a giant poison cloud which covers the entire arena and deals constant damage while standing in it. Players need to remain mobile and avoid being tethered to anything whilst inside the poison cloud.

**阿克的毒云** - 阿克会释放一个巨大的毒云，覆盖整个竞技场，在其中停留会持续受到伤害。玩家需要保持移动，并避免在毒云中被任何东西捆绑。

**Whisperer's Pull** - Whisperer will place a large AOE on the ground followed by a purple cone attack which will pull all players to the center of the AOE. Players need to avoid being pulled in as the damage dealt is especially heavy when several players are stacked on top of one another. 

**低语者的牵引** - 低语者会在地面上放置一个大范围攻击，然后用紫色的锥形攻击将所有玩家拉到AOE中心。玩家需要避免被拉进来，因为当几个玩家堆叠在一起时造成的伤害尤其重。 

**Big Rabbu's Fury** - Big Rabbu will enter a furry which will leave heavy shockwaves on the ground which deal massive area of effect damage. Players need to avoid these shockwaves and remain mobile to avoid taking damage.

**大拉布的狂怒** - 大拉布会进入狂怒状态，留下巨大的电击波，对地面造成大范围伤害。玩家需要避免这些电击波，并保持移动以避免受到伤害。 

其他词语翻译：
- AOE：范围伤害
- stun：眩晕
- tethered：被拴住
- burst damage：突发伤害

* **Daedric Explosion** :  这个技能会周期性地使用，还会在使用了 Web Pull 后使用。它是一个巨大的扩散范围技能，当它扩展到最大时会爆炸，你必须散开避免受到伤害。一些坦克可以通过格挡来承受，但会被击倒。注意闪避，等到技能结束后再重新接近。

* **攻略翻译如下
蜘蛛恐惧症** :  这就是为什么你们需要站成三角形的原因，让每个dps和治疗者有自己的空间。如果她盯着你看并向你射出水平散射弹幕，你需要翻滚躲开。如果你的时机准确，那么你将可以避免受到攻击并像平常一样继续战斗。如果没有，屏幕会变白，你会看到蜘蛛幻象，你会被昏迷3秒并受到严重的网击，这通常会直接秒杀一个dps或治疗者。翻滚躲开攻击并回来，不要在战斗中浪费耐力，确保你随时有足够的耐力来躲避攻击，因为她会随机选择受害者。

为保持战斗的清洁，请保持队形，闪避弹道攻击，并始终躲避大范围AOE攻击。不要在房间里乱跑！祝好运！

> ** SPINDLEKIN **
> 
> This Particular fight is pretty basic and exactly what you would expect from a tier 1 first boss. It has some basical light attacks which most people should be able to survive but the dps should block if they hit them, a heavy attack that needs to be blocked and then some basic mechanics to follow through out. It is a pretty fast fight and really the tank shouldn't have too much of a problem holding the spider still while the dps stand behind it and kill it.
> 
> **Summon Spiders** - Throughout the fight Spindlekin will summon small spiders to assist it in the fight, these are the same spiders you have encountered already, low health, they spit poison in frontal aoe and ground web aoe and can feed off of dead targets. Be sure as the tank to bring these in close to or stacked onto, the main fight area, around the boss. Most aoe damage should kill these but be sure to interrupt them if they try to feed/heal.
> 
> **Devour** - Very much like the regular spiders in this dungeon Spindlekin can also devour dead enemies on the ground to heal. This is quite a substantial heal and can be a pain if the damage in your group is low and/or the team is inexperienced so to prevent this mechanic from happening you must interrupt it as soon as you see the affect happening. Basically you are looking for a visual where it appears to be 'eating' a dead spider. If you can do this, the boss won't be a problem.
>

> 
> Swarm Mother
> 
> 
> ** THE SWARM MOTHER **
> 
> This boss is very similar to the last, still a large spider still has light and heavy attacks but if not properly controlled can be a LOT more mobile than the last. It is important that the dps and healers stand CLOSE and behind the boss. The tank needs to focus on chaining in additional spiders(or taunting from range) so the stack on the boss at the same time as making sure the boss stays as still as possible turned AWAY from the group. Note: do NOT run around the room, running will just make things messy and you will die anyway.
> 
> **Summon Spider** - Just like the last boss, this boss also summons spiders throughout the fight and these need to be taunted, and/or chained in and pinned by the tank WITHOUT making the bsos run around the room. They can be killed fast with aoe damage but be sure your group is looking out for any that try to feed/heal from dead bodies. If you catch them doing it, interrupt them. also stay out of their poison/web aoe.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Occasionally Swarm Mother will stand up on hear hind leggs and launch a powerful heavy attack at the tank or whoever has agro at the time, you MUST block this.
> 
> **Leap** - She will LEAP occasionally to a random target, hitting them hard and knocking them down. Stay together, stay close and you will be fine. HOWEVER if she does leap at you, block or dodge roll don't run away! And once it is over, get back in as close as you can. The group needs to hug up else she will keep leaving the aoe damage.

> This boss is a tricky one, she isn't particularly difficult but she does have a LOT of additional enemies in the room. The tank should grab the melee as soon as possible and then start to chain in the ranged targets while holding onto the boss. The dps should be able to aoe down the enemies quite quickly but should focus the healers and the mages, they hit very hard and must sometimes have their channeling abilities interrupted. Stay out of circles on the floor, fire damage in here is quite nasty.
> 
> **Flurry** - Not strictly called flurry but she does have a flurry type attack with fast light attacks aimed at the tank or whoever has agro, this isn't very strong but i would highly recommend blocking it if it is aimed at you especially since the room of damage incoming combined can be problematic.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - A straight forward heavy attack no different to any other visually, while she winds this up be sure to have your block ready. She wont kill a tank if it doesn't block but she can wipe out a weaker dps so be careful. ALWAYS block a heavy attack. Again, do NOT run away.
> 
> **Immobilize** - She casts a channeling ability and when it is complete she will stun/immobilize the target. Usually the tank, you can break free of it but you can ALSO interrupt it before it happens. Keep your eyes open and stop her from doing this.
>

> Big Rabbu

> ** BIG RABBU **
> 
> This boss is simple but has a nasty attack which can catch you out. Firstly the tank needs to of course grab agro of the boss, you do NOT want him hitting the dps or healer. Then while agroed, try to grab as many enemies into the center of the fight as possible while keeping interrupts on the ranged and healer type enemies to prevent heals and too much incoming floor damage. For the dps keep up as much damage in AOE as possible to thin out the numbers and then eventually burn down the boss. Do NOT run around in circles, block and interrupt as and when you need to. Running will kill you.
> 
> **Grip** - Just like the dragonknight chain ability, Rabbu can also chain players in as well. He will chain and then volley with a light attack so if he pulls you in block, get out of the way and then carry on hitting him in the side/back.
> 
> **Charge** - This ability is extremely easy to see and avoid but people mess it up a lot. A large strip of dangerous aoe will appear on the floor marking the path he is about to charge through. If you get caught in this you have two options, Block, or move slightly out of it. If you do not do either of the two and are not the tank, he will knock you down and kill you. Be careful!

> 
> The final boss in Spindleclutch is a bit of a challenge, she is a MASSIVE spider in Mephala's image so to speak and is quite terrifying to look at. The room is full of enemies to start with. Be sure to pull all of the enemies into the door way making sure they are stacked up for aoe damage and the healers and ranged are interrupted. DO NOT run into the center of the room as you will pull the boss before you are ready.
> 
> The tank will need to position the boss where ever he/she sees fit(the middle is fine) after the enemies are all dead and stay as still as possible, turning her away from the group.
> 
> The dps and healer should ALWAYS stand in a triangle formation ready to pay attention to the incoming mechanics. DO NOT stack up, you MUST all have your own space else this gets very tricky.
> 
> **Impale** - Pretty standard melee attack which will only hit whoever has agro, usually the tank, this can be blocked and/or mitigated if you have lots of resists and health.
> 
> **Web Pull** - A chain like mechanic where she pulls players into the center where she is standing with a very short duration stun, this needs to be kept an eye on because when this happens she usually follows up with a 'Daedric Explosion'(coming next)
> 
> **Daedric Explosion** - This happens periodically AND after the Web Pull. This is a MASSIVE spreading aoe and once it reaches full size it explodes, you MUST spread out and avoid this else you are dead. Some tanks can stand up to it if blocking but this will knock them down. Get OUT and get back in again when it has finished.
> 
> **Arachnophobia** - This is the reason you stand in a triangle formation as dps and healers, you ALL need your own space. If she LOOKS in your direction she is firing this projectile at YOU. When this happens, dodge roll. If you timed it right you will avoid it and can carry on as normal. If not, the screen will go white, you will see hallucinations of spiders, you will be stunned for 3 seconds and be hit with a nasty web blast which will normally 'one shot' a dps or healer. Dodge roll it and get back in again, do NOT waste stamina during the fight, be sure you always have enough to dodge roll because she picks her victims randomly.
> 
> To keep this fight clean, stay in formation, dodge roll the projectile and always void the big aoe. do NOT run around the room! Good Luck!
