### 被诅咒者


这个首领很简单，但是对那些试图快速通过机制的人有很大的惩罚性影响。由于它的血量很低，这个首领可以被很快地击败，但是如果致命的机制启动，团队可以杀死与首领仇恨的那个人。要小心！在坦克方面，战斗相对简单，抓住首领，把它背对团队并保持静止。先击败小怪物，然后转而专注于首领。

* **轻攻击** :  一种非常简单的轻攻击，会打击仇恨目标（应该是坦克）。这种攻击伤害较轻，即使是输出/治疗也能承受一两击，不用太担心，但如果多次攻击，累计的伤害就会增加。

* **冰封洪流** :  这个技能和大多数幽灵类型的敌人一样，会以冰属性范围攻击的方式瞄准目标并冰冻他们的双脚，造成大量伤害。坦克可以承受住，但输出职业会根据其韧性和cp属性分配而失去高达70％的生命值，所以要小心。需要注意的是，这个技能可以被打断！

* **生命汲取** :  这个技能是导致人们死亡的罪魁祸首。它会附着在随机一个玩家身上，然后吸取他们的生命，但是造成的伤害是基于他所承受的伤害！你曾经可以通过闪避来打破吸取，但现在不再行得通，你可以通过远程攻击来打破吸取，但是根本的问题在于过度燃烧...基本上在这一点上，所有的输出职业都应该停止攻击BOSS！等到技能结束后再进行攻击...小组中的所有伤害都会转移到技能附着的玩家身上，所以是的，你可以伤害你自己的小组。要小心！


### 灵魂收割者乌尔古娜


这是一个非常简单的血量较低的BOSS，并不会造成太多的问题。坦克应该要把她稳定住并将她的面对团队，并且团队需要协作以使这个击杀迅速而干净，因为即将有一个令人窒息的机制会让一个玩家变得无用......帮助你的团队！

* **冲击波攻击** :  这个首领偶尔会在她面前释放一个火焰类型的aoe，会产生轻微的击退和强大的伤害。通常应该瞄准坦克，但如果不是，可以简单地阻挡它或向一侧移动以避免被伤害。

* **悬浮/窒息** :  这个BOSS会随机选中一个玩家，并将他们悬浮在空中，使他们无助。他们什么也做不了，不能摆脱束缚也不能使用任何能力。这个技能的窍门在于会有4个治疗球/宴席飞向BOSS。如果它们到达BOSS，她将会恢复生命值，但如果你摧毁了它们全部，你就能让你的队友从这个魔咒中解脱出来。要快速地摧毁它们，否则那个队友将会陷入严重的麻烦，特别是如果他是治疗师或坦克！





### 骷髅死神



这个BOSS房间一开始就有很多小怪，大多都是远程攻击的，所以你的坦克需要把它们拉到房间中央，这样小组就可以尽快使用AOE伤害来清除它们，同时BOSS也正在赶来的路上。当小怪清理到一半的时候，BOSS通常就会走进房间里了！做好准备！

* **重击** :  Boss会释放一个类似于重击的前方AOE技能。 只要坦克将Boss带离团队，团队就会安全，而坦克将需要格挡它。 它的攻击力不算太强，但如果你被打中就会被击退，所以确保要格挡住。

* **骷髅** :  在整个战斗中，首领会从脚下召唤出骷髅（每次3个），必须快速击杀，否则它们会爆炸并造成范围伤害，就像《被流放的牢犯I》中的首领一样。

* **冲锋** :  尽量把Boss面向墙壁或柱子。原因是他会跑过整个房间，一直跑到他想停下来或撞到墙为止。当他冲锋时，他会击倒他路径上的任何人，并留下一道矿物类型的AOE，必须避让。请记住，这是与位置有关的问题，如果你能让他面对靠近你的墙壁，他的冲锋距离会短一些；如果你面对的是空地，他会跑很远，DPS会不断地重新应用他们的伤害，并浪费地面上的AOE和能力资源。



### 格罗斯达尔


这个Boss在游戏中有一些最酷的声音效果，如果小组成员关注自己的脚步操作，这个Boss并不会太难。

* **猛击** :  这很简单，拥有攻击引导权的人（坦克）将受到一个非常响亮的重击，直接格挡即可，即使是DPS或治疗也可以格挡，声音比实际攻击更重。但是，如果你不格挡，你将被击倒。

* **过热** :  首领将释放一种类似充能的能力，并带有令人讨厌的前方范围伤害，这相当严重，但可以格挡，应该远离小队。记住，坦克应该始终将首领转向团队。DPS和治疗者不应该站在此范围伤害中！

* **熔岩路径** :  整个战斗期间，房间中会有两条蜿蜒的熔岩路径移动。它们会造成相当大的伤害，应尽可能避免。它们有一种追逐玩家的习惯，会让你频繁移动。记住要始终站在boss后面以避免被他攻击，但在避开这些熔岩路径时，有一点小技巧可以让事情变得更容易...

跟随熔岩路径的尾巴，头部就永远无法追上你 :)


### 阿查莱祖尔

这很简单，血量非常低，但是如果不小心就会被压垮。坦克应该把这个Boss转向远离团队的方向，以便他的AOE不会攻击到他们。房间里有很多小怪，它们应该尽可能被拖到中间，以便可以使用AOE杀死它们并集中攻击Boss。不过，你不必一次性杀死或引起所有的小怪。如果直接穿过房间中间甚至在去Boss的路上潜行，你就不会引起远程攻击的小怪，这将使战斗更容易。

* **火焰吐息** :  这个不需要太多常识就能理解，这是Typical Deadroth（一种游戏中的怪物）使用的火焰吐息。它会朝着仇恨值最高的玩家方向释放，你可以躲避它，或者用盾格挡。如果你是输出或治疗角色，你千万不要被它打到。

* **火球喷射** :  像传统的Deadroths一样，它会喷出火球并在撞击地面后放置aoe。如果你看到这个攻击正在来袭，简单地格挡它，如果你被攻击打中，你会被击倒。尽快解除束缚并远离火焰区域！



### 至古者


这个敌人属于监视者类型，可能在其他游戏中也见过，很容易击败。关键在于坦克必须将敌人背对团队。大部分致命攻击都在敌人正面。作为输出或治疗不要站在敌人面前！

* **Beam** :  一种绿色的三叉形激光束，会以前方范围伤害的形式缩小到目标身上。对易受伤害的敌人造成高额伤害，被命中的角色将会失去平衡并需要摆脱这种状态。作为输出或治疗角色，一定要避免受到这种攻击，而坦克则应该能够承受住它。如果操作得当，只有坦克会受到这种攻击。

* **旋转** :  旋转攻击是一种令人讨厌的技能，会对范围内造成高额伤害。作为输出和治疗者，你可以远离攻击范围或者继续保持高生命值。只要有足够的治疗来支持，这个技能应该不会有大问题，但如果你在被攻击时生命值没有满，就有可能死亡。所以要保持足够的生命值。

* **Enrage** :  当Boss剩余生命值很低时，其范围伤害会增加，因此在Boss生命值低时要保持治疗并尽可能快地击杀它，以防止此问题的发生。其中"Enrage"指的是一种增强状态。





### “预兆”伊斯克拉



这个任务并不像看起来的那么棘手或艰难，但局势可能很快就会变得不利。它的健康值很低，但它拥有一些大范围攻击技能，所以一定要注意。坦克应该让它保持在中央，而小组成员则尽可能靠近（同时注意机械装置）。如果每个人都保持密切联系，但有自己的空间，而不是堆在彼此脚下，那么很容易看出谁即将成为攻击焦点。

* **吐息** :  这是一个朝着一个玩家的超大直线火焰吐息技能，目标是随机的，因此我们需要自己的站位。一旦你能看到它要攻击的玩家，那个玩家只需要向一侧移动并让技能通过即可。技能会留在地面上，不要站在上面。

* **跳跃重击** :  病理魔物会直接跳到空中并重击地面。这个很简单，闪避/向后滚动并避免接触，然后尽快回到位置上。一旦病理魔物结束这个技能，很重要的是你必须再次接近它。

* **跳跃** :  这个BOSS会对距离他最远的人进行跳跃攻击，所以要保持近距离！如果你太远了，BOSS跳的距离会非常远，你就需要花费更多的资源在巨大的房间里奔跑以重新施加伤害。诀窍是整场战斗尽可能地保持接近距离。这样当BOSS选择一个玩家时，你已经如此接近，之前施加的伤害会得以延续。BOSS只会移动几英尺而不是几英里！保持接近。跳跃攻击会像跳跃一样造成大面积的溅射伤害，需要避免。其中，

记住，遵循机制，出去，再回来！





### 疯狂建筑师



** 疯狂建筑师 **

这个Boss在游戏中拥有一些最酷的视觉机制，但只要人们专注，它就是一个非常简单的Boss。坦克需要始终将Boss背对着团队，而治疗和DPS则需要留在Boss背后。

* **不死族仆从** :  在整场战斗中，首领会召唤小兵，你必须快速除掉它们。坦克应该嘲讽/缚住他们，同时DPS应该使用AOE伤害杀死它们。每个人都必须留在与首领在同一圆圈内，不要在房间里乱跑，那样会很混乱！

* **狞笑弹（Grinning Blot）** :  对单个目标造成高伤害的技能，通常瞄准具有仇恨的人。坦克一定不能放弃嘲讽，否则可能会抹掉易死的队员！其中，“坦克”是指承担敌人攻击的队员，保护其他队员不受攻击的角色。

* **符文** :  BOSS会在地面上施放符文。如果你被它们困住，你就会承受高伤害并被缓速/定身。不要站在符文上。不要像小孩子一样逃跑，简单地向一边移动并避开它们。记住，像一只无头鸡般乱窜会给小组带来压力。放松！

* **致命的灵魂（快离开）** :  这个非常明显... Boss会施放一个技能，地面会发出亮粉色光芒，灵魂会从地面冲出。这是一个非常简单的机制，快离开！不要站在里面。等它过去后再回来！

* **致命念力（不离开）** :  这与上面相反，boss会在他和队伍周围形成一个保护圆顶，而圆形的外侧将会有一些疯狂的形状和图案在房间中四处破坏整个小队…这是一个简单的机制，只需留在圆圈中即可。其中已知专有名词为灵魂（Spirit）。

以上两个机制是随机的，但如果你理解它们就很容易遵循......粉色地板出去，保护罩里待着！

祝你好运！

> The Cursed One
> 
> 
> ** THE CURSED ONE **
> 
> This boss is a very simple one with a very punishing side affect to people who try to burn through mechanics. This boss CAN be killed very fast due to it's low health BUT if his fatal mechanic kicks in, the  group can KILL the one with the boss agro. BE CAREFUL! The fight is fairly simple in regards to tanking, grab the boss, turn it away from the group and keep it still. Kill the adds FIRST then focus on the boss.
> 
> **Light attack** - A very simple light attack which will hit the person with the agro (should be the tank) this is very light damage and even a dps/healer can take a slap or two, not too much to worry about but multiples of course can add up.
> 
> **Frozen Torrent** - This is identical to most Wraith type enemies, an ice aoe will aim at the target and freeze their feet on the spot doing a lot of damage. A tank can take it but a dps will loose up to 70% of their health depending on their resists and cp allocation so be careful, note, this is interruptible!
> 
> **Drain Life** - This is what gets people killed. This life draining beam will attach to a random player and drain their life BUT the damage is based on the damage he TAKES! You used to be able to break with a dodge roll but you no longer can, you can break with range however if you get away far enough BUT the fundamental problem with this is over burning...basically at this point all dps players should STOP DAMAGING THE BOSS! Wait for the beam to finish and then carry on...all damage done by the group is transferred to the player with the beam,. so YES you can kill your own group. Be careful!

> Ulguna Soul Reaver
> 
> 
> ** ULGUNA SOUL REAVER **
> 
> This is a very simple lowish health boss and doesn't cause too much of a problem. The tank should hold her still and face her away from the group and the group WILL need to co-ordinate to make this a quick and clean kill as there is a stifling mechanic coming up which will render a player useless...HELP your team!
> 
> **Wave Attack** - This boss will occasionally cast a flame type aoe in front of her which issues a slight knock back and strong damage. This should normally be aimed at the tank but if not, simple block it or move to the side to avoid it.
> 
> **Levitation/stifle** - The boss will pick a random player and suspend them in mid air rendering them completely helpless. They can do nothing, they cannot break free nor use any abilities. The trick to this is there will be 4x healing orbs/feasts heading towards the boss. If they reach her she will heal BUT if you destroy them ALL, you will release your group member from the spell. Do this FAST or else that team mate will be in some serious trouble, especially if it is the healer or the tank!
> 
> 
> 
> Death's Head
> 
> 
> ** DEATH'S HEAD **
> 
> This boss room starts with MANY adds in the room, mostly ranged ones too so your tank will need to pull these into the middle of the room so that the group can dispatch them with AOE damage asap while the boss is on the way in. Half way through the adds the boss usually walks into the room! Get ready!
> 
> **Slam** - The boss will cast a frontal aoe ability like a slam. So long as the tank is turning the boss away from the group the group will be safe and the tank will be required to block it. It is not too strong but if you are caught you will be knocked back. So be sure to block it.
> 
> **Skeletons** - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn skeletons from his feet (3x at a time) kill these fast or else they will explode and do aoe damage, much like the boss in Banished Cells I.
> 
> **Charge!** - Try to face the boss towards a wall or pillar. The reason for this is he will charge across the room (much like the leviathan in Crypt of Hearts I) and will keep running till he feels like stopping or hit a wall. When he charges he will knock down anyone in his path and leave behind a trail of mine type aoes which must be avoided. Remember this is about positioning, if you can get him to face a wall CLOSE to you, his charge will be short, if you are facing empty space, he will run a long way and the dps will constantly have to keep re-applying their damage and waste resources on ground based aoes and abilities.
> 
> 
> 
> Grothdar
> 
> 
> ** GROTHDAR **
> 
> This boss has some of the coolest sound effects in the game and is a pretty straight forward boss if the group focuses on their foot work.
> 
> **Slam!** - This is very simple, the person with agro (the tank) will be hit with a very LOUD clanging heavy attack, simply BLOCK it, even a dps or healer can block this, the sound is heavier than the hit. BUT if you do not block it you will be knocked down.
> 
> **Overheat** - The boss will cast a charged up like ability and hit with a nasty frontal aoe affect, this is pretty harsh but can be blocked and should be kept away from the group. Remember the tank should always turn the boss away from the team. DPS and healers should NOT stand in this aoe!
> 
> **Lava Trails** - During the whole fight there will be 2 snaking lava trails moving around the room. These do quite a lot of damage and should be avoided as much as possible. They have a habit of chasing players to make you move around a lot. Remember to stay behind the boss regardless of distance so you don't get hit by HIM but while avoiding these lava trails there is a little trick you can do to make things easier...
> 
> FOLLOW the TAIL of the lava trails and the head will never catch you :)
> 
> 
> 
> Achacraizur
> 
> 
> ** ACHACRAIZUR **
> 
> This is very simple, has very low health but you CAN get over whelmed if not careful. The tank should turn this boss AWAY from the group so that his aoes don't'  hit them. There are many adds in the room and they should be pulled into the middle as much as possible so that they can be killed with aoe while focusing the boss. HOWEVER you do not have to kill or even agro all of the mobs at once. If you walk straight through the middle of the room or even sneak around on the way to the boss, you won't agro the really far ranged ones and this will make the fight much easier.
> 
> **Flame Breath** - This doesn't take a lot of common sense to figure out but this is the flame breath a typical Deadroth uses. It will be cast in the direction of the player with the agro and this can be either stepped aside from, OR blocked. If you are a dps or healer you do NOT want to get hit with this.
> 
> **Fireball spit** - Like traditional Deadroths he will spit fire and place aoes on the ground after they impact. If you see this coming, simply block it, if you get caught with it you will be knocked down. Break free as fast as possible and get OUT of the fire!
> 
> 
> 
> The ancient one
> 
> 
> ** THE ANCIENT ONE **
> 
> This one is typical of the watcher type mobs you have probably seen before in other content and is very simple to kill. The key to this is that the tank MUST face it away from the group. Most of the dangerous stuff is in front of him. As a dps or healer do NOT stand in his face!
> 
> **Beam** - A green trident shaped triple beam which closes in on the target in the form of a frontal aoe. This does HIGH damage to squishies and anyone caught in it will be knocked off balance and will be required to break free. Avoid this at all costs as a dps/healer, the tank should be fine and if done properly the tank will be the only one that receives this.
> 
> **Spin** - The spin  attack is a nasty one and does high damage in aoe. As dps and healers you can move away from this OR keep doing what you are doing with high health upkeep. So long as the heals are coming in this should be fine but if you are not max health when this hits, you run the risk of dying. So HP maintenance is key.
> 
> **Enrage** - With low health the bosses aoe damage escalates so at low health keep up the heals and execute it as fast as you can to prevent this from being a problem.
> 
> 
> 
> Iskra The Omen
> 
> 
> ** ISKRA THE OMEN **
> 
> This one is not as tricky or as tough as he looks but things can go wrong quickly. He has low health and some LARGE aoe abilities so make sure you pay attention to this. The tank should keep it dead center while the group stay as close as possible (while watching out for mechanics). If everyone stays close but has their OWN SPACE, not stacking on each others feet, it is easy to see who is about to be focused.
> 
> **Breath** - This is a flame breath ability in a HUGE straight line aimed at ONE player, The target is random so hence why we have our own positions. Once you can see who it is going to hit, that player simply needs to move to the side and let it pass.  It will remain on the floor so don't stand in it.
> 
> **Jump/slam** - The ill jump straight up in the air and slam the ground. Very simple this one. Dodge roll/run backwards and avoid it, then get back IN to position asap, it is VERY important that you get close again once it is gone...
> 
> **Leap** - The boss will LEAP to the person FURTHEST away in this fight, so STAY CLOSE! If you are too far away it will jump for MILES and you have to spend more resources running around this massive room to reapply damage. The trick is to stay as close as possible the whole fight. That way when it selects a player you will already be so close that the damage already applied will be continued. The boss will move a couple of feet rather than a couple of miles! STAY CLOSE. The leap hits with a large aoe splash just like the jump and should be avoided in the same way.
> 
> Remember, follow mechanics, get out, then get back in again!
> 
> 
> 
> Mad Architect
> 
> 
> ** MAD ARCHITECT **
> 
> This boss has some of the coolest visual mechanics in the game but is a very simple one so long as people focus. The boss needs to be faced away from the group by the tank at all times, while the healer and the dps stay behind him.
> 
> **Undead Minions** - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn adds, you must get rid of these fast. The tank should taunt/chain them in while the dps kill them with aoe damage if possible. EVERYONE must stay in the circle with the boss, do not run around the room it will be a mess!
> 
> **Grinning Blot** - High damage single target bolt which is usually aimed at the person with agro. The tank must NOT drop taunt as this can wipe a squishy!
> 
> **Runes** - The boss will cast runes on the ground. If you are caught by these you will take HIGH damage and be snared/immobilized. Do not stand in them. Don't run away like a baby, simple move to one side and avoid them. Remember running like a headless chicken puts pressure on the group. Relax!
> 
> **Stay in - Get Out!!**
> 
> **Lethal Spirit (get out!)** - This is extremely obvious...The boss will cast an ability where the ground will glow bright pink and souls will rush from the floor. This is a very simple mechanic, GET OUT! Do NOT stand in it. Let it pass then get back in again!
> 
> **Lethal Telekinesis (stay in!)** - This is the opposite of the above, the boss will put a protective dome over him and the group and the outside of the circle rather than the middle will smash to pieces with some crazy shapes and patterns around the room which will destroy the group...simple mechanic...STAY IN!
> 
> The above two mechanics are random, but they are easy to follow if you understand them...pink floor get out, protective dome, stay in!
> 
> Good luck!
