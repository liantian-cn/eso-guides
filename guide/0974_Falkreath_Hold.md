## 佛克瑞斯领地





### 莫丽格·牛血

> MORRIGH BULLBLOOD


**莫丽格·牛血**

这个首领在机制方面非常简单。坦克应该将首领放在区域的中心，并将牛头人放在首领上方。集中火力先击败牛头人，但要远离它，然后再击败首领。

* **重击** :  首领偶尔会进行重击。无论目标是谁，这都需要被格挡。然而，应该是坦克来承受此招式。不要放弃嘲讽。在这场战斗中，没有人需要在房间里四处奔跑。

* **攻城护盾** :  当首领血量降至50%时，会释放一个技能，创建一个类似攻城护盾的防护效果，以保护您在混乱中存活。在短暂的击退攻击后，会在房间周围不断遭受投石车类型的攻击。

这很容易操作。只需要进入护盾内部，集中攻击并燃烧首领即可。

* **地面AOE** :  BOSS偶尔会在地上放出负面AOE。这是一个相当小的圆圈，通过简单地踏出它来轻松避开。无需翻滚和拼命奔跑，只需移开即可确保安全。





### 攻城猛犸象

> SIEGE MAMMOTH


攻略：

这里是攻城大象战斗。注意躲避它的巨力踏和箭矢攻击，并攻击它的弱点来获得额外伤害。准备好强大的团队和装备，挑战这个强大的敌人吧！

这是一个不太愉快的首领！他很难保持静止，并且有很多范围效果，如果你不小心，他会给你造成一些可怕的一击。管理这个首领的一个简单方法是让坦克将它靠近大门，并将自己的背朝向大门本身。坦克应该站稳脚跟，坚守阵地，而团队则从后面包围大象。

* **攻略翻译如下

践踏** :  在战斗中，猛犸象会试图用其长距离的地面范围冲锋能力（典型的剑盾敌人但要大得多）践踏/冲击它的对手。只要坦克把猛犸象对准了城门，它基本上没地方可去，所以只会弹开。坦克应该阻挡这个攻击。如果出现了BOSS失控并且攻击方向发生了改变，团队必须避开。

* **攻略

头槌** :  在战斗中，首领将尝试使用大力量头槌攻击拥有仇恨的人（应该是坦克），试图用他的牙齿击中对方。这个动画很明显，很容易发现。当这种情况发生时，坦克必须格挡。

* **火焰** :  在整个战斗中，有些随从在山上，你不能击杀他们。他们会不断在左右两侧向小组施放地面移动的火焰范围技能。不要慌张，只需避开它们并在它们逼近你时之间穿梭闪过。

* **重踏** :  这个机制非常重要！当猛犸象的生命值低于50％或与其他机制重合时，它会站起来，并进行巨大的重踏！每个小组成员现在都需要立刻格挡，否则就会瞬间死亡！不要错过这个机制！





### 塞伦农

> CERNUNNON


**塞伦农**

这个Boss有些棘手，如果你不了解它，就必须注意一些关键点，否则就会失败。坦克应该尽量吸引并聚集所有3个小怪物。由于其中2个远程攻击，这变得更加困难，所以在视频中我们让坦克抓住近战小怪，在弓箭手上方放置它！这可以防止战斗过于分散。

* **死亡圆环** :  这个区域是一个旋转的恶劣环境。不要离开这个区域，如果你这样做了，你会受到严重的伤害而死亡。这就是逃跑会害死你的地方！

* **小BOSS** :  这个房间里有3个小BOSS/敌人，一个弓箭手，一个法师和一个近战敌人。近战敌人应该堆叠在弓箭手上，而法师必须单独应对（先击杀这个）。

每个敌人都有可以被打断的机制，如果他们正在释放技能，就必须将其打断。法师会造成高伤害和控制效果，弓箭手则会造成非常难缠的火焰点燃伤害。而近战则有一个巨大的范围性攻击需要躲避。在与他们战斗时要注意这些问题。如果你不能在足够快的时间内将其打死/打倒至0%的血量，他们会变得愤怒并变得更加强大。尽管仍然可以应对，但在这个阶段打断的重要性更加突出，否则你几乎可以保证一招必杀。

* **光明** :  每当你将三个敌人的血量降为0%时，他们会坐下，并在脚下显示绿色圆圈。玩家必须走过去拾取它(这会改变他们的屏幕视觉效果，施加减速和持续性伤害)。一旦拾取，它必须被放入周围三个灯中的一个。每次拾取会熄灭一个灯。一旦你拥有了所有的三个，注意房间中央，那里会从中间出现骨骼巨像(主头目)。

* **重击** :  主要的Boss有一个具有相当强的击退效果的重击。这一点必须用盾牌格挡！坦克必须始终嘲讽Boss，因为如果DPS或治疗师受到这个攻击，他们可能会死亡。

* **幽灵** :  幽灵会生成并在房间内旋转，如果你碰到它们，它们会使你受到惊吓。所以要看好你的脚下。它们对所有伤害免疫。

* **骷髅** :  在与主要BOSS的战斗中，会出现骷髅，请尽快击杀它们，它们的攻击伤害极高。暂停攻打BOSS，先清理小怪物。

* **冰石陨落** :  在战斗中，首领会举起手臂，每个小队成员都会受到被附加的大面积伤害效果追踪。你必须散开，不要重叠在一起，并且保持格挡，直到冰石陨落到每个玩家身上。如果你未能格挡，你将被击杀或承受巨大伤害并被晕眩。如果你重叠在一起，当然会承受双倍伤害并死亡。要小心，这里需要空间意识。

一旦Boss的血量降低到51%，他将会消失，原来的迷你Boss们将重新出现在它们最初的位置。重复整个开始的过程，直到所有的Boss都被打倒，所有的灯都被熄灭（就像你在开始时已经做过的那样）。Boss会再次从中间出现，现在只需要击杀它就可以了。除了你已经看到的那些机制，不会再有额外的机制了。





### 死亡领主巴尔弗鲁德·斯科阿尔莫

> DEATHLORD BJARFRUD SKJORALMOR


** 死亡领主巴尔弗鲁德·斯科阿尔莫 **

这个BOSS非常简单，但如果控制不当会很乱。坦克应该将BOSS保持静止并始终背向团队！团队可以站在BOSS背后形成一个半圆，同时试图杀死它。不要在房间里四处奔跑，一旦小怪出现很快就会让这场战斗变得一团糟。

* **吐息** : BOSS将施放一个负面的前锥形AOE，在其中的任何人都会受到快速、高持续伤害。坦克可以格挡，但DPS和治疗需要避开此技能。

* **增援怪物** :  会有大量的亡灵增援进入战斗。坦克需要尽快拉住这些增援怪物，并希望它们在靠近boss的位置死亡。这是那些跑来跑去、表现像无头苍鸡的玩家将要惨败的地方。如果玩家在房间里跑来跑去，增援怪物就会被安置到不合适的位置，死在荒谬的地方，接下来的阶段将几乎无法管理。迅速杀死所有增援怪物，并让它们靠近主boss...

* **清理** :  当小怪死亡时，它们尸体上会有一束光线。你需要指派一个队员去到房间后面的坛子那里，拾取清理的协同技能，然后跑回来清理尸体。如果所有的尸体都靠近坦克，那么这可以完成得非常快...但是如果尸体散布在整个房间里，这将变成一场疯狂的冲刺来清理它们，如果不能在规定时间内完成，则可能游戏结束...

**大爆炸！** — 当房间内有足够的敌人（无论死活）时，首领将开始引导一种能力，并且每个玩家的脚下都会出现一个快速扩散的区域伤害。切勿聚在一起。

如果正确完成了净化过程，你将幸存下来，没有爆炸会发生。如果你错过了一个净化过程，它会爆炸，但你应该没事。但是，如果在AOE达到峰值之前有超过1个或2个+身体没有得到净化...轰隆一声你就死了！

进行净化操作，不要只顾着输出伤害而轻视机制，有些人可能可以，但不是每个人都行。请跟随机制进行操作。





### “血角”多米豪斯

> DOMIHAUS THE BLOODY-HORNED


**“血角”多米豪斯**

这就像是“茶杯店里闯进了一头公牛”，房间非常小，协调至关重要！尽可能要一起行动，这样你们很快就能完成任务。如果四散而行，你们将会连续几个小时地失败。坦克必须始终让BOSS集火，并且时刻保持嘲讽，否则他会秒杀团队成员。所以一定要注意！他永远不会移动，不会追人，但是会远程攻击。

协调的诀窍是决定你要走房间的哪一侧，通常大多数人都走左边。在需要的时候，记住左边的柱子，你需要一起前往它（稍后会提供更多信息）。

* **重击Haduken** :  战斗中，Boss会用类似长距离Haduken的重击攻击威胁仇恨最高的玩家。这就是为什么坦克绝对不能丢失Boss的仇恨。如果坦克可以格挡这次攻击，他们将活下来。但如果没有格挡，或攻击其他人，他们就会死亡。作为 DPS/治疗，如果你看到它来了并且足够快地闪避，你可以幸存下来。但最重要的是，坦克不应该丢失Boss的仇恨。

* **烈焰（又称角落）** :  BOSS将从房间四周的地面召唤烈焰。没错，你不必被迫走到中间。这个阶段在视频中被称为“角落”。原因是，地板上有一个小的正方形平台。每个队员需要尽快走到中间，分散到四个角落，这样没有人站在其他人身上。这是因为下一个机制要求你不要重叠。

* **吸入并融化** :  一旦按照以上所述的位置站在中央位置，首领将会使用大型吐息或吸入机制，拉动所有成员到他身边，你们会在空中悬停一瞬间。

攻略翻译如下：
当他把你放下来之后，你们每个人身上都会有自己的 dot 效果，在大约一秒钟的时间内在地上掉下多个 aoe（与蹂躏者牛头人一样）。每个成员必须慢慢地向后走，从他们的角落走开，把每个 aoe 整齐地放在地上。在向后移动时，如果你没有地方可走，而且你将要撞到火墙，继续向前走，但变为向右…所有玩家都必须这样做。“向后向后向后，向右！”如果一个成员搞砸了并走相反的方向，你们会叠在朋友身上并杀死他们。如果你们不断移动，a o e 会掉在你们身下，堆积起来并杀死你，如果你们没有角落，多个玩家会叠放他们的 aoe，人们会死亡…这是至关重要的。

当首领没有喊叫、没有砸击和没有变成石头（即将出现）时，应该重新定位在拐角位置。

* **猛击** :  在战斗中，首领会失去耐心并开始猛击地面。房间中央会有一个大型范围效果，并且火球会飞过地面。这可能会导致任何玩家死亡，不仅是因为猛击，还可能是因为流落的火球。

记住你指定的小组应该靠近的柱子了吧？躲在后面，不要站在房间中间，利用这个柱子来避开火球。在这个阶段，如果你小心，可以探出头，扔下dot，嘲讽等等，但不要停留在中间。

注意：要小心火焰/角落阶段可能会在此之后或期间发生（有时机制会根据团队DPS重叠），所以要准备好在他完成后立刻进入中央。

基本上现在我们已经明确了，在房间外面起火的时候你要紧贴在角落处，其余时间则紧贴在柱子上。

* **增援** :  在战斗期间，首领会变成石头，然后会出现4个元素阿特隆克。一定要集中攻击它们。我强烈建议在这个阶段使用终极技能来快速击败它们，以免“血角”多米豪斯醒来。

**喊叫！！！**——这是胜败的分水岭。注意你选择的那根柱子，因为你会需要它！

在生命值分别为70％、50％、30％、10％和5％时，Boss会“呐喊”（然后每分钟一次，直到战斗结束，你死亡或他死亡）。当Boss呐喊时，你们所有人都必须躲在柱子后面。这需要协调配合。每个有玩家躲在后面的柱子会在Boss呐喊时被摧毁，因此所有人都要躲在同一个柱子后面，你们只会一次失去一个柱子。一旦柱子被破坏，你们所有人就集中攻击下一个柱子，直到剩下的战斗结束。一旦下一个柱子被摧毁，就移动到下一个，以此类推。

需要注意两个问题。困难模式将在房间中一开始移除两根柱子。并且，如果你在龙吼期间没有躲藏好，你就会死亡！

* **执行** :  当Boss的血量极低时，它会获得一个伤害护盾并召唤小怪。这非常关键。从现在开始每分钟都会生成小怪，所以你必须集中火力打它们，所有的机制都在运作，火，角落，地震和火球，哈杜肯，所有的东西。坦克在这里承受着巨大的压力。保持Boss嘲讽，抓住小怪，不要逃跑。小组需要尽可能地杀死所有小怪。每当Boss的伤害护盾消失时，他会试图重新应用它，延长执行阶段。

许多团队试图单纯地推动Boss，但失败了，因为他们被重复出现的小兵淹没了。这个技巧是在清理小垃圾的同时造成被动伤害。保持你的持续伤害效果，随着小兵的清理，“血角”多米豪斯逐渐会被消灭。特别是在这个阶段你有终极技能的时候。

注意：如果你的小组有高伤害，许多机制可能会重叠。因此，血量的百分比并不总是适用，因为当你打败一个机制时，他可能正在进行另一个机制。所以在这些情况下（如视频中所示），你必须更加注意。打开字幕会有帮助。

一起合作，注意空间认知。集中攻击小怪先，然后再打BOSS...祝你好运！

> MORRIGH BULLBLOOD
> 
> 
> ** MORRIGH BULLBLOOD **
> 
> This boss is about as easy as they come mechanics wise. The tank should hold the boss dead center of the area and hold the Minotaur on top of the boss. Focus down the Minotaur first as the group but stay OUT of it's face, then proceed to beat down the boss.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss will occasionally heavy attack. This simply needs to be blocked regardless of who the target is. However, this SHOULD be on the tank. Don't drop taunt. There is no reason for anyone to be running around the room on this fight.
> 
> **Siege** - The boss cast an ability at 50% health which will create a siege shield type effect for protection while all around is chaos. Barrages of trebuchet type damage will be surrounding the room after a brief knock back attack.
> 
> This is quite easy to work with. Simply get inside the shield and stack and burn the boss.
> 
> **Ground aoe** - The boss will occasionally put a negative aoe on the ground. This is a pretty small circle and can be easily avoided by simply stepping out of it. No need to dodge roll and run like mad, just move out of it and you will be safe.
> 
> 
> 
> SIEGE MAMMOTH
> 
> 
> ** SIEGE MAMMOTH **
> 
> This is one unhappy chappy! He is hard to keep still, has plenty of aoe effects and some nasty one shots if you are not careful. An easy way to manage this boss is for the tank to hold it near the gate with their back to the gate itself. The tank should plant their feet and hold their ground while the group surrounds the mammoth from behind.
> 
> **Trample** - During the fight the mammoth will try to trample/charge down it's opponents with a long ranged ground aoe charge ability (typical of sword and board enemies but MUCH larger). So long as the tank has the mammoth faced to the gate, it pretty much has no where to go so will just bounce off the game. The tank should block this. If for some reason the boss goes loose and this is aimed a different direction, the group MUST avoid it.
> 
> **Headbutt** - During the fight the boss will attempt to heavy attack the person with agro (should be the tank) with a big swinging headbutt trying to hit with his tusks. This is quite a lot animation so easy to spot. When this happens the tank MUST block.
> 
> **Flames!** - The whole way through this encounter there are minions up on the mountains which you cannot kill. They will constantly cast ground moving flame aoes at the group from the left and the right. Don't panic, simply step out of them and weave between them as they come towards you.
> 
> **STOMP!** - This mechanic is crucial! At low health (under 50% or so depending on dps and overlapping mechanics) the mammoth will rise up onto his back legs and do a massive stomp! Every member of the group needs to block NOW, or take a one shot! Do not miss this mechanic!
>

> CERNUNNON
> 
> 
> ** CERNUNNON **
> 
> This boss is a tricky one if you don't understand it but there are some key points that must be payed attention to or else it is a guaranteed wipe. The tank should try to agro all 3 adds to start with and hold them together as much as possible. Since 2 of them are ranged this becomes difficult to manipulate so what we did in the video is to get the tank to grab the melee add, and place it on top of the archer! This stops the fight being too split up.
> 
> **Circle of death** - The area is a swirling circle of nastiness. Do NOT leave the circle. If you do, you will die from HEAVY damage. This is where running away will kill you!
> 
> **Mini bosses** - There are 3 mini bosses/enemies in the room, an archer, a mage and a melee enemy. The melee should be stacked on the archer and the mage dealt with separately (kill this one first).
> 
> Each enemy has interruptible mechanics which MUST be interrupted if they are channeling. The mage will cause high damage and cc, and the archer can cause a VERY nasty flame dot. The melee on the other hand has a huge aoe that must be avoided. Be aware of these when you are fighting them. If you do not kill/knock them to 0% fast enough they will enrage and get much stronger. They are still manageable but the interrupts are even MORE important at this stage else they are going to one shot you almost guaranteed.
> 
> **Lights** - Each of the 3 enemies you knock down to 0% health they will sit down and have a green circle under their feet. This must be picked up by a player by walking over it (this will alter their screen visuals , apply a snare and do damage over time). Once picked up it must be deposited into one of the 3 lights surrounding the area. Each pick up will put out ONE light. Once you have all 3, pay attention to the middle of the room where the bone colossus (main boss) will come out from the middle.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The main boss has a heavy attack with a sizeable knock back. This must be blocked! The tank needs to taunt the boss at all times because if a dps or healer receives this attack they are likely to die.
> 
> **Ghosts** - Ghosts will spawn and spin around the room, if you touch these they will fear you. So watch your feet. These are immune to all damage.
> 
> **Skeleton** - During the fight with the main boss, skeletons will appear, be sure to kill these as soon as possible, they do a LOT of damage. Lay off the boss and get the adds, down.
> 
> **Ice Comet!** - During the fight the boss will raise his hands and each member of the group will be followed by a massive attached aoe effect. You must spread out, do NOT overlap them and hold block until the ice comet lands on each player. If you fail to block you will be killed or take huge damage and be stunned. If you overlap them you will of course take double damage and die. Be careful, spacial awareness is required here.
> 
> Once the boss reaches 51% health he will de-spawn, and the original mini bosses will re-appear in their original locations. Repeat the whole starting process again until they are all down, and all the lights have been put out (just as you already did at the beginning). The boss will come back out of the middle and it is just a case of now killing him. No more additional mechanics to the ones you have already seen.

> DEATHLORD BJARFRUD SKJORALMOR
> 
> 
> ** DEATHLORD BJARFRUD SKJORALMOR **
> 
> This boss is extremely simple but can be messy if not controlled. The boss should be held still by the tank and turned away from the group at all times! The group can then stand behind the boss in a semi circle while attempting to kill it. DO NOT run around the room. Running around will make a mess of this fight very quickly once the adds come in.
> 
> **Breath** - The boss will cast a negative frontal cone shaped aoe which does fast, high damage over time to anyone caught in it. A tank can block it but dps and healers need to avoid this.
> 
> **Adds** - There will be MANY undead adds entering the fight. The tank will need to pull these in as soon as possible and you want them to die CLOSE to the boss. This is where headless chicken maelstrom shuffle type players will fail miserably. If players run around the room, the adds will be misplaced, die in stupid places and the next phase becomes almost impossible to manage. Kill all adds quickly and CLOSE to the main boss...
> 
> **Cleanse!** - During when the adds die they will have a beam of light sticking out of their corpses. You need to assign one member of your group to go to the urns at the back of the room and pick up the cleanse synergy, then run back and cleanse as many bodies as possible. If all of the bodies are close to the tank then this can be done very fast...but if the bodies are all over the room this becomes a mad rush to get rid of them all and then it could be game over for you...
> 
> **BIG BOOM!** - Once enough enemies are in the room (dead or not) the boss will start to channel an ability and each player will have a fast spreading aoe under their feet. Do NOT stack up.
> 
> IF the cleanses were done correctly you will survive and no explosion will happen, if you missed 1 cleanse then it will explode and you should be ok. BUT, if more than1 or 2+ bodies are not cleansed by the time the aoe hits its peek...BOOM you die!
> 
> Get those cleanses in, don't go yolo dps burn thinking you can get away with it. Some can, but not many. Follow te mechanics!

> 
> This quite literally a 'bull in a china shop'. The room is tiny and co-ordination is KEY! Stay together as much as possible and you will do this in no time. Scatter around the room and you will fail for hours at a time. The tank MUST have a taunt on the boss at all times else he WILL one shot group members. So pay attention! He never moves so he will not start chasing people but he will hit from range.
> 
> The trick to co-coordinating is to decide which way around the room you are going to go. Generally most go left. when it counts, remember which pillar is on the left and you will need to travel to it together (more info coming up).
> 
> **Heavy attack/Haduken!** - During the fight the boss will heavy attack whoever has agro with a long ranged Haduken type attack. THIS is why the tank must NEVER drop taunt. If the tank blocks this, they will live. But if not blocking, or it hits anyone else, they WILL die. If you see it coming as a dps/healer and are quick enough to dodge roll you can survive it, but above all, the tank shouldn't drop the boss.
> 
> **Flames (aka corners)** - The boss will call up flames from the ground AROUND the room. Thats right you are not FORCED to go into the middle. This is the phase in the video i call 'corners'. The reason being, there is a small square platform on the floor. Each member needs to get in the middle as soon as possible and separate on to each one of the four corners so NO ONE is standing on anyone else. This is because the next mechanic is coming and requires your to NOT stack.
> 
> **Suck in and melt** - Once in the middle in position as explained above, the boss will do a large breath or suck in mechanic which will pull all members to him and you will hover in the air for a split second.
> 
> When he drops you, you will ALL have your own dot effect on you which will drop multiple aoes on the ground about a second apart (same as the trampler Minotaurs). EACH member must walk backwards from their corners SLOWLY to place each aoe neatly on the ground. While moving backwards if you have no where to go and you are going to end up hitting the fire wall, continue walking but instead of backwards go to your RIGHT...ALL players must do the same. 'back back back RIGHT!'. If ONE member messes this up and goes the opposite direction, you will stack on a friend and kill them. If you don't keep moving the aoes will drop under you and stack up and kill you, and if you do not have corners, multiple players will stack their aoes and people will die...this is crucial.
> 
> The corners positions should be resumed whenever the boss is NOT shouting and NOT slamming and NOT in stone (coming up.)
> 
> **Slam!** - During the fight the boss will loose his temper and start smashing the ground. There will be a big aoe in the middle of the room and fire balls will fly across the floor. This can potentially kill any player not just from the slam but from the stray fire balls.
> 
> Remember the pillar you assigned your group to stick to? Hide behind it, get out of the middle of the room and utilize the pillar to avoid the fire balls. During this phase if you are careful, peek your head out and throw down dots, taunts etc etc but do not stay in the middle.
> 
> NOTE: be careful as the fire/corners phase can happen after or DURING this (sometimes mechanics overlap depending on group dps) so be ready to get into the middle as soon as he is finished.
> 
> Basically at this point we have clearly established that you pretty much hug your corner spots when the fire is on the outside of the room, and the rest of the time, hug your pillar.
> 
> **Adds** - During the fight the boss will turn to stone and 4 elemental atronachs will spawn. These MUST be focused. i would highly recommend using ultimates at this stage to kill them fast before Domihaus wakes up.
> 
> **SHOUT!!!** - THIS is the difference between winning and losing. Pay attention to that pillar you chose because you are going to need it!
> 
> at 70%, 50%, 30%, 10% and 5% health the boss will 'SHOUT' (then once a minute until the fight is over, you dead or him) when he does this you will ALL have to hide behind a pillar. The trick to this is co-ordination. Each pillar that has a player behind it will be destroyed when he shouts, so all stay behind the same one and you will only loose one pillar at a time. Once the pillar is down, you all focus on the NEXT pillar to your left as the NEXT safe spot for the remainder of the fight. Once that pillar is down, move to the next and so on.
> 
> Two things to note. Hard mode removes two pillars in the room from the beginning. And also, if you do not hide during the shout you are DEAD!
> 
> **Execute** - At very low health the boss will gain a damage shield and spawn adds. THIS is crucial. Adds will spawn every minute from now on so you MUST focus them down, all mechanics are in play, fire, corners, ground slam and fire balls, Hadukens, EVERYTHING. The tank is under serious pressure here. Hold the boss taunt, grab the adds and don't run away. The group needs to kill all adds as much as possible. Each time the damage shield of the boss falls off he will try to re-apply it prolonging the execute phase.
> 
> Many groups try very hard to just push the boss and fail getting overwhelmed with adds on repeat. The trick to this is passive damage while clearing out the trash. Keep your dots up and Domihaus will gradually go down as the adds do. Especially if you have ultimates at this stage.
> 
> NOTE: A lot of the mechanics can overlap if you have HIGH damage in your group. So the % of health dos not always apply because he can be going through one mechanic when you push him. So in these instances (as shown in the video too) you WILL have to pay even closer attention. Put on subtitles, it helps.
> 
> Work together, focus on spacial awareness. Adds first, boss second...enjoy and good luck!
