## 真菌岩洞 II

> Fungal Grotto II




### 梅法拉的獠牙

> Mephala's Fang


**梅法拉之牙**

攻略翻译如下：

这个首领非常简单，是一种“保持静止并痛击”的类型，但是有几件事需要注意。坦克应该将首领从团队身后转过来，尽可能静止。其他玩家应该保持在它的背后。有两个小怪应该被快速击杀，但只要坦克将它们和首领拉在一起，它们就不会很快被全体AOE伤害杀死。

* **重击** :  像字面意思一样，首领会对拥有仇恨的人进行重击，只需格挡即可安全应对，即使你是一个输出职业也是如此，但如果失败了，你会被击倒。

* **攻略翻译如下
喷洒** :  Boss会对坦克或者仇恨目标进行前方范围毒雾攻击，可以被打断。

* **攻略
毒药** :  Boss将在随机成员脚下放置毒药数秒钟。千万不要在毒药中停留超过一秒钟，找一个安全的缺口并躲开。最简单的方法是（因为可能会有多人获得自己的圆点）聚在一起堆叠起来。如果你们聚在一起并且毒药掉落，所有人一起移动到下一个安全点，然后再次掉落时，所有人再一起移动，以此类推。你们这样做是因为如果你们中的多个人同时获得了毒药圆点，它们会一起放置在一个位置而不是扔在整个房间中。如果人们开始在房间里转圈，房间会被填满，你将无处可去，最终导致死亡。坦克应该保持静止，无论发生什么，他/她都能承受一部分的伤害，只要有些小治疗及时到位。





### 加梅尼·班杜

> Gamyne Bandu


**加梅尼·班杜**

这个Boss是地下城的队伍杀手。很多团队无法击败这个Boss，不是因为她特别难打，而是因为人们没有注意需要做什么（或者不知道）。需要团队成员集中注意力、合作并注意机制。坦克需要始终将Boss引导，让她背向团队，团队应该总是站在她的后面并注意她的AOE攻击。

* **重击** :  首领会尝试近乎隐身但同时蹲下并开始进行一次重击，你必须格挡这个攻击否则你会被击退，并且这可能会杀死一个dps/治疗。

* **攻略翻译如下

缓慢一击** :  这是会消灭整个队伍的机制！BOSS 的四个暗影会钉住队伍中的一个成员至地面。必须击败其中一个暗影才能解救你的队友。因此，团队必须集中火力攻击一个暗影！此副本因为人们总是试图单独击败自己的暗影而消灭大量队伍。只需击败一个暗影，问题便得到解决!

* **攻略翻译如下

束缚爆炸** :  首领会在2名玩家身上施加一个发光的效果，他们将被束缚在一起。散开并朝两个<strong>不同的方向</strong>奔跑以打破束缚，一旦束缚解除就再次靠拢。如果您没有打破束缚，你将会爆炸并死亡。

* **暗影** :  在战斗期间，首领会分裂成4个暗影，必须在她重新生成之前杀死它们。当它们死亡后，她将立即带着重击回来，所以请确保每个人都在阻挡，在没有嘲讽效果的情况下选择dps/治疗者为目标。





### Fungal Grotto II的中文翻译为真菌岩洞 II。它是一个地下洞穴迷宫，在Elder Scrolls Online游戏中作为一个副本存在，玩家需要与各种敌人作战，包括boss Gamyne Bandu和Spawn of Mephala等。

> Ciirenas The Shepherd


** 牧羊人CiiRenas **

攻略翻译如下：

这个boss通常被称为“长时间战斗”，人们常常会跳过它，仅仅是因为他们不了解机制。这些机制比看起来要简单得多，而且这是一场非常快速的战斗。坦克应该始终把嘲讽敌人的技能放在boss身上（近战或者远程），而不是去嘲讽蜘蛛。同时，队伍需要尽可能地对单个目标进行集火，并小心不要造成过多的范围伤害。

* **攻略翻译如下

暗影箭** :  这个BOSS会在战斗中随机向小组成员发射黑暗魔法属性的抛射物，这种情况经常发生，但可以被打断，这让她的攻击变得毫无用处，继续攻击她但记得要一直打断。但是注意不要在击打/打断时把她打到悬崖下（最好从BOSS的后面打断），这样会使她跑得太远而重新开始这场战斗，所以请小心。

* **攻略翻译如下
标记蜘蛛** :  在整场战斗中，首领将随机标记一个小组成员。这个标记会影响到你，这是她告诉她的蜘蛛攻击你。唯一的吸引蜘蛛的方法是你成为目标。如果你成为目标，移动到房间的另一侧，带上蜘蛛并保持存活。如果必要，坦克也可以帮助你在这里固定蜘蛛，使它们停留更长时间。其他人应该专注于攻击首领。

不要杀死蜘蛛！每一只你杀死的蜘蛛都会让她的抵抗力得到增强，如果所有的蜘蛛都死亡，你对头目的伤害只有10%。没错，你的30k重攻击现在只能最多造成3k的伤害……你的1k标准攻击现在只能造成100的伤害等等。蜘蛛的生存是关键，否则你将在那里守整天！





### 梅法拉的后裔

> Spawn Of Mephala


**梅法拉的后裔**

这个首领非常简单，但如果有人在房间里乱跑，就可能会出问题。因此，只有在必要的情况下才移动。坦克应尽可能稳定地控制首领，并远离传送门。

* **重攻击** :  这个很简单，无论你扮演的是什么角色（应该是坦克），一定要格挡重攻击，否则你会被击倒。

* **span style  colorffff00传送门** :  房间后面的传送门会在整个战斗中带走一名小组成员。每次传送门吞噬一个人，他们必须在传送回来参加战斗前杀死约7到8只蜘蛛。这种情况会在战斗中不断发生，直到BOSS的生命值降到一个低的水平。因此，重要的是确定谁进入传送门。最接近传送门的人会被吸进去。这就是为什么正确的站位很重要，不要在房间里胡乱奔跑。同时，需要找一个有能力的DPS玩家以保持战斗输出。

* **攻略翻译如下
爆发** :  在战斗期间，角色的身体会释放一个范围AOE攻击，造成高伤害并且有击退效果。可以简单地远离攻击范围，坦克可以格挡它。

* **攻略翻译如下
炸弹** :  在战斗期间，首领会将一束光束附加到一个AOE上，跟踪一个玩家在房间内移动，躲避它直到它爆炸，然后回到原位（躲避=跟随它以避免它击中你或其他人）。如果它接触到了玩家，将会造成高伤害，如果你同时受到了这两种攻击，你将会死亡。





### 雷格尔·暗晨

> Reggr Dark-Dawn


攻略翻译: 

** 雷格尔·暗晨 **

这个BOSS很简单，但是事情可能出错。房间周围的小怪可以完全避免，如果你在房间中间打BOSS，但如果玩家开始"yoloing"（意为高风险行为），四处奔跑，他们将加入战斗并增加一些麻烦，例如晕眩等，这是你不想要的，所以要小心谨慎地走进房间。坦克应将BOSS背向团队并保持静止。团队应站在BOSS的后面，也要保持静止！

* **攻略翻译如下

旋风** :  首领会把他的武器围绕着头旋转，任何被囊括在范围内的玩家都会承受高伤害，只需要简单地远离它...我指的是远离它。范围非常小，不要在房间里乱跑，没人会因为你跳舞而感到 impressed，而且你还会把周围还没有被引起注意的敌人拉进战斗。

* **攻略翻译如下

重击** :  首领会对坦克（或者嗑药仇恨的人）进行重击。这个攻击非常强力，可能会击飞你并吸引房间里的小怪的注意。不过，如果你格挡了它，你将会受到非常小的伤害，所以不要错过格挡的机会。

* **耗尽魔力** :  BOSS将武器高举在空中，大约持续5秒钟，从整个小组中迅速耗尽魔力，这对于魔法角色来说是一个巨大的痛苦（同时也会造成伤害）。确保在整个战斗中进行大量的重击，以保持你的资源充足，否则你会有麻烦。





### 维拉·瑟兰

> Vila Theran


** 维拉·瑟兰 **

真菌岩洞 II 的最终Boss有一些简单却具有毁灭性的机制。如果你们团队配合得好，你们就能轻松通过，但是务必要一起努力。保持团队凝聚力。治疗师应该尽可能地专注于保持团队存活，坦克应该尽可能地保护团队并时刻保持嘲讽。Fungal Grotto II的最终Boss名为加梅尼·班杜，要小心其梦幻攻击。如果你被攻击了，立即离开攻击范围。同时要注意不要让特拉朝你释放梅法拉的后裔。最后，打败Boss之后要小心蕾纳和伊拉的出现。如果你们过于疏忽，很可能会死在蕾纳和伊拉的手中。击败Boss之后，前往维拉·瑟兰处领取奖励。雷格尔·暗晨也会在那里等着你。

* **轻攻击** :  这对输出和治疗角色造成了非常大的伤害，所以一定要确保嘲讽不会消失！

* **攻略翻译如下

激光束** :  在战斗中，老板定期举起她的法杖，将光束连接到小队中的每个玩家身上，从而消耗他们的生命值。这会造成很大的伤害，但可以通过伤害护盾和治疗来减轻，因此你的治疗和坦克需要在这个阶段中全力保护小队成员。

注意：这个房间里有一个大的否定气泡。如果你进去，这将保护你免受这一阶段的影响，但这会取消硬模式。硬模式是通过永远不站在气泡里来实现的。如果你想在硬模式下完成，团队中的所有成员都不应该靠近它。远离它！

* **攻略翻译如下

传送和黑洞** :  每个阶段结束后，首领会传送到团队中的3名成员，一个接一个。因此，她会从一个成员跳到另一个成员，直到她安定下来。每个传送将在地面上放置一个黑洞，它会扩散到巨大的大小，而站在里面会导致死亡。这就是团队合作发挥作用的地方。

如果你在房间里四处乱跑，头也不顾，会在房间中间留下很多黑洞，从而被清除。但是，如果你一直保持同一位置，相互重叠在一起，那么她会传送到你们三个人之中。由于你们都在同一位置，她会将所有黑洞放在一起，可以让你们控制它们的位置……

攻略翻译如下：这个策略很简单。靠近梅法拉，让她放置她的暗影，然后移动到房间的另一边并用远程攻击打败她。每次她传送时，重复这个步骤。靠近她，移动到房间的另一端，这样打法需要花费较长时间，但是如果按照这种方法执行，非常有效且容易。

祝你好运！

> This boss is very simple kind of 'hold it still and smack it type' but there are a couple of things to keep an eye on. The tank should turn the boss away from the group and hold it as still as possible. while the group stay BEHIND it. There are two adds that should be killed fast but as long as the tank pulls them with the boss they won't last very long to standard aoe damage from the group.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - As simple as it sounds, the boss will heavy attack the person with agro, simply block this and you will be fine, even as a dps, but fail and you will be knocked down.
> 
> **Spray** - The boss will spray poison in a frontal aoe at the tank or whoever has agro, this can be interrupted.
> 
> **Poison** - The boss will select random members of the group to place poison for a few seconds under their feet. Do NOT stand in this for more than a second or so, find a gap and get safe. The easiest way to do this (incase multiple people get their own dots) is to stay together and stack up. If you stack up and poison lands, ALL together move to the next safe spot, then when it drops again, all move together and so on. You do this so that if more than one of you get a poison dot at the same time they are both placed together in one spot rather than thrown all over the room. If people start running around in circles the room will be filled and you will have no where to go, and you will die. The tank should stay still no matter what as he/she can take the damage so long as small heals are incoming.

> This boss is the PUG KILLER of the dungeon. So many groups do NOT pass this dungeon because they cannot kill this boss. It isn't that she is particularly difficult to kill, it is more of a case of people not paying attention (or unaware) of what needs to be done. Focus, work together and pay attention to the mechanics. The tank needs to taunt the boss at all times and turn her away from the group, the group should always stand behind her and watch for her aoe attacks.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will try to almost stealth but at the same time crouch and wind up a heavy attack, you must block this or you will be knocked back and it can kill a dps/healer.
> 
> **Slow One Shot** - This is the mechanic that will destroy groups! ONE member of the group will be pinned to the floor by 4x shadows of the boss. just ONE shadow must be killed and your group member will be released. So it is essential that you as a group focus ONE SHADOW! Every time this dungeon wipes a group on this boss it is because people all try to show off killing their own shadow. kill ONE and it is problem SOLVED!
> 
> **Tethered Blast** - The boss will put a glowing affect on 2 players, and they will be tethered to each other with a beam. Spread out and run two DIFFERENT directions to break the beam, once it is gone come back in again. If you don't break the beam you will explode and die.
> 
> **Shadows** - During the fight the boss will split into 4 shadows that must be killed before she respawns again. When they are dead she will instantly come back with a heavy attack so be sure everyone is blocking in case she has lost a taunt effect and picks a dps/healer as a target.

> This boss is commonly known as a 'long fight' and people skip it far too much simply because they do not understand the mechanics. They are a lot simpler than they look and it is a very fast fight. The tank should ALWAYS keep a taunt on the boss (close or ranged) and NOT taunt the spiders.In the mean time the group need to focus as much single target as possible and be careful to not do too much aoe damage.
> 
> **Shadow bolt** - Randomly through out the fight the boss will Fire dark magic type projectiles at members of the group, this happens a LOT but it can be interrupted making her attacks pretty useless, keep hitting her but be sure to interrupt all the time. Be careful not to push her off the cliff bashing/interrupting though (interrupt from behind the boss not in front if you can help it. Failing this will basically make the her go to far across the room and reset the fight so be careful.
> 
> **MARK/Spiders** - Throughout the fight the boss will mark one member of the group at random. This mark affect is her telling her spiders to hit YOU. The ONLY way to agro the spiders is if YOU are the target. If you are the target, move to the other side of the room, take the spiders with you and stay alive. A tank can help you pin the spiders here also if necessary too to make them stay there longer. Everyone else should focus the boss.
> 
> DO NOT!!! kill the spiders! Each spider you kill buffs her resists and if all spiders die you will ONLY do 10% damage to the boss. That's right, your 30k heavy attack now does 3k maximum...your 1k hits now do 100 etc etc. It is KEY that the spiders survive or you will be there all day!

> 
> This boss is VERY straight forward but can go wrong with people running around the room. So only move when you HAVE TO. The tank should try to hold the boss as still as possible the whole fight and stay AWAY from the portal.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is very simple, no matter what role you are (should be on the tank) be sure to block the heavy attack or you will be knocked down.
> 
> **Portal** - The portal at the back of the room will open up and suck in a member of the group through out the fight over and over. Each time the portal pulls someone in, they will have to kill a about 7 or 8 spiders before the portal will let them leave again and come back to the fight. This happens constantly throughout the fight until the boss reaches low health. The trick to this is to be sure that a capable dps player can kill and survive in there...THIS is based on positioning so you can decide who goes in. The CLOSEST person to the portal is the one who gets sucked in. This is why it is incredibly important to fix your positions and not run headless around the room.
> 
> **Burst** - During the fight the emit a large aoe burst from her body which does high damage and knocks back if caught. Simple move away from this, the tank can block this.
> 
> **Bomb** - During the fight the boss will attach a beam to an aoe that will follow a player around the room, kite this until it explodes and then get back into position (kite = move with it to avoid it hitting you or anyone else). If it touches a player it will deal HIGH damage, and if you are caught with both this and the burst combined you WILL die.

> This boss is simple but things can go wrong. The adds around the room can be completely avoided if you fight the boss in the middle of the room, but if people start yoloing and running around then they will join the fight and add some complications in the form of stuns and such which you do NOT want to have to deal with, so walk in the room carefully. The tank should turn the boss away from the group and stand still. The group should stand behind the boss and also STAND STILL!
> 
> **Whirlwind** - The boss will spin his weapon around his head and anyone caught in the aoe will take high damage, simple step out of it...and i mean STEP out of it. The aoe is TINY, do NOT run around there room, there is no need, people are not impressed with you dancing, and you WILL pull the surrounding (not yet agroed) enemies into the fight.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will heavy attack the tank (or whoever has agro). This is a really hard hitting heavy attack and will knock you back possibly attracting the attention of the adds around the room. However if you block it you will take a very small amount of damage, so don't miss the block.
> 
> **Drain** - The boss raise his weapon in the air and for around 5 seconds or so, drain magicka rapidly from the whole group, this is a royal pain if you are a magicka build (does damage also) make sure through the whole fight you get in plenty of heavy attacks to keep your resources up or else you will be in trouble.

> The final boss in Fungal Grotto II has some simple yet devastating mechanics. If you focus as a group you will pass this with flying colours but you must work together. Stay together as a team. The healer should focus as much as possible to keep  the group up, the tank should shield the group if possible and ALWAYS hold a taunt.
> 
> **Light attacks** - These hit dps and healers REALLY hard so make sure that taunt doesn't drop off!
> 
> **Beams** - Periodically throughout the fight the boss will raise her staff in the air and attach a beam to each player in the group draining them of their health. This does a LOT of damage but it can be mitigated with damage shields and heals, so your healer and tank need to play full protectors during this phase.
> 
> NOTE: there is a big negate bubble in the room. If you run inside this will protect you from this phase BUT you will cancel hard mode. Hard mode is achieved by NEVER standing in the bubble. No members in the group should ever go anywhere near it if you want that hard mode clear. Stay away!
> 
> **Teleport and black holes** - Every time each phase finishes the boss will teleport to 3 members of the group, one after the other. So she will jump from one to the other until she settles. Each teleport will place a black hole on the ground which will spread to a massive size and standing in it WILL kill you. This is where working as a team comes into play.
> 
> If you run around the room headless all spread out, you will fill the room with black holes and you will wipe. BUT if you stay stacked on each others feet the whole time, she will teleport to 3 of you BUT since you are all on the same spot, she will place the black holes all together. Allowing you to control where they go...
> 
> This tactic is simple. Hug up, let her place them, and them move to the other side of the room and kill her from range. Every time she teleports, do it again. Hug up move to the other side of the room. It is ranged a ranged and a long fight this way but it is incredibly effective and easy if done this way.

> Good luck!
