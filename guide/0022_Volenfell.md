### 沙漠狮

> Desert Lion


**沙漠狮**

这个Boss很容易，因为大多数首个Boss都是如此，但你必须注意自己的资源。有一个主Boss（沙漠狮）和四只雌狮。坦克应该尽快抓住这些小兵并把它们堆到Boss上。如果你是DPS或治疗者，不要在房间里到处跑，因为狮子正在试图吃掉你，只需要靠近坦克，这样他或她就可以吸引Boss的仇恨。小兵很快就会被AOE击杀，因为它们血量很低，然后你就可以专注于Boss了。

* **重击** :  这是大多数首领的非常简单和常见的机制。它是一个典型的重击，必须用盾格挡，否则你将被击倒。无论你是坦克还是其他职业，如果这个攻击瞄准了你，你必须要用盾格挡住它。

* **咆哮** :  有时首领会改变位置，使战斗稍微有些流动性，同时会发出咆哮声！这正是你预期狮子咆哮会做的事情，它会恐惧整个团队。你会失控地朝随机方向奔跑约3秒钟，而他会跳到某人的背后。所以，一旦你看到这个机制，请确保你解除控制并重新回到位置。这就是为什么你应该注意你的资源。确保你随时拥有足够的体力来在需要时解除控制。

在战斗中，DPS和治疗应该远离Boss前方，并大部分时间保持原地不动。没有其他危险机制。坦克需要保持嘲讽，并让团队尽力燃烧Boss。





### 奎因图斯·韦雷斯

> Quintus Verres


**奎因图斯·韦雷斯**

这个首领非常棘手。他有三个阶段！第一个阶段他是一名近战类型，使用双手武器；第二个阶段他是一名法师，有很多的火属性伤害；最后他会召唤一个石像鬼来收尾！

beginning, so that the boss doesn't go after the healer or other squishy members. The boss will periodically jump around while spawning more adds, so make sure the dps stays on top of killing them. When the boss lands, burn him down as much as possible and be careful of his heavy attacks. Once the boss is defeated, make sure to loot the body for any valuable drops. This strategy can be applied to other boss fights as well, such as Whirlwind in Darkshade Caverns I or Desert Lion in Ardia. For more difficult bosses like Len, En and Mor, it may require more coordination and specific mechanics to defeat them. Make sure to communicate and strategize with your team, and utilize your skills and potions wisely. As a Mage, you can also utilize your spells and abilities to control the field and deal heavy damage to the bosses. With determination and teamwork, you can conquer even the toughest challenges in Elder Scrolls Online.

* **第一阶段** :  战士 - 首领会对拥有仇恨的玩家进行重攻击，使用他的双手武器。这个玩家应该是坦克，因为坦克拥有嘲讽技能，然而如果你是 dps 或治疗师，请不要惊慌，也不要逃跑。只需要格挡即可。但如果你未成功格挡，则会被击倒。

偶尔他也会执行像旋风般的攻击，他会将武器在头上旋转。作为一个输出或治疗职业，你必须避开这个攻击，因为它会造成很多物理伤害。不需要四处奔跑，只需躲避并等待攻击结束即可。

* **阶段二** :  法师 - 首领现在完全改变了战斗风格，使用火焰法杖进行攻击。他会不断地放出火球，坦克应该是唯一的承受者，只要他/她保持嘲讽。如果你作为输出或治疗吸引了Boss的仇恨，只需要格挡直到坦克再次获得仇恨，你就会没事的。

他的重型攻击会在地面放置一个大火焰范围攻击技能，一定要避开。这个技能会迅速杀死你，所以请注意自己的立足点。最后，Boss会对坦克使用火焰灵魂技能并造成恐惧效果。如果你是坦克，请确保你的体力池足够，这样你就可以在出现这种情况时摆脱恐惧状态。

* **第三阶段** :  石像鬼 - 当BOSS已经快要死了的时候，他会召唤下一个巨大的石像鬼。他看起来并没有那么可怕。让你的坦克把他定位在房间中央，而DPS和治疗则要找一个不用跑来跑去危险的地方来发挥他们的作用。石像鬼会用连续攻击来攻击坦克（或任何被攻击的人）。大多数坦克都能够经受住这个攻击，但如果不能，可以简单地进行格挡。其他角色也是一样，格挡是可以的。

该游戏攻略翻译如下：
石像鬼会向随机一个玩家喷气（不要堆在一起），并将其变成石头。这可以通过打破来摆脱，因此一定要保持足够的耐力，以防您成为目标。在第一次喷气后，它会疯狂地砸地面，直到结束为止，你必须躲避。然后战斗重复，使它乱舞，进行两次喷气然后砸地。重复这个过程。如果你是dps / healer，请远离他的面部，你会没事的。

记得要躲避猛击区。





### 炙咬

> Boilbite


** 沸腾咬喉 **

这个BOSS很简单，但攻击伤害极高。首先有四个小怪，坦克应该将他们堆叠在BOSS身上，其余队员应该找到一个适合自己的位置，不要直面BOSS。小怪很弱，可以被范围攻击消灭。现在是集中攻击BOSS的时候了，请注意防御。

* **传送** :  就像刺客甲虫一样，这个首领也可以传送，小心一点，当它发生时一定要格挡，并准备好移动。最初的攻击伤害很大，但他通常会跟着下一次攻击。

* **火焰爆裂** :  这个boss会停下来，然后从他的身下扩散出一个范围攻击。

与大多数范围伤害不同的是，它在爆炸时不仅仅会造成伤害。这个范围技能实际上会每秒产生火焰伤害，直到它达到最大尺寸后才会爆炸。如果你作为一个 dps 或治疗者没有离开这个范围，你就会死亡。它的攻击力非常强大，你必须尽快逃离。坦克应该能够承受住它的攻击，但其他人则不行。

一旦这个机制结束，回到原位并继续攻击。重复此过程，直到战斗结束。

这是一场非常简单的战斗，但如果你做错了就会毁灭性的。





### 战栗之鳞

> Tremorscale


** TREMORSCALE **，表示游戏中的一个Boss名称「TREMORSCALE」，其中黄色字体为Boss名称的标识。

这个Boss比看起来要容易击败得多，他的攻击非常基础，很容易避免。说实话他的攻击力也不是那么强，但当然按照机制进行打击总是更安全的。

* **尾巴抽打** :  偶尔，Boss会发出咆哮并转向他的一侧。当他这样做时，会发生锥形AOE，他会抽打尾巴。这将朝着坦克或者谁拥有仇恨的方向进行。你有两个选择，要么格挡它，要么躲避它。两种选择都可以，但如果你失败了，你就会被打倒在地。

* **洞穴** :  这个机制其实很有趣。首领会钻进地底，随机选择一名受害者。被选中的人会在他们身下出现一个喷发的AOE，而首领会从地下爆出，对任何被困在AOE中的人造成伤害。实际上这并不会很痛，但你应该尽快躲闪或逃离，并回到原位。

坦克应该一直站在BOSS的面前，而DPS/治疗应该一直站在BOSS的后面或旁边。

不要在房间里乱跑，否则挖洞的机制可能会变得有些混乱。放松心情，避开危险，然后回到正确的位置。





### 不稳定构造体

> Unstable Construct


**不稳定的构造物**

这个首领有点棘手。房间很小，他的攻击非常快。坦克应该抓住首领和所有小兵，而团队则要找到一个适合他们站立的好位置，避免到处乱跑。

* **闪电** :  Boss会朝着地面发射一道闪电。你会看到一个小圆圈aoe瞄准你或团队中的另一个成员，你可以格挡这个攻击，但最安全的方法是向一侧移动，避开攻击。

* **旋风攻击** :  此攻击在原地进行，角色会站立不动并旋转躯干。这会造成相当严重的物理伤害，但如果你距离角色约3-5米，或者使用格挡，你将可以很好地抵挡住攻击。

* **猛击** :  在战斗过程中，首领将变成球形并跳跃着猛击地面。他的脚下会有一个小AOE区域，所以要避开它。这个技能比较简单，只有大约3米宽，很容易躲避。

* **炸弹** :  团队中的一个成员偶尔会在他们脚下产生一团大范围伤害。这就是炸弹，如果你跑进团队，你会炸掉他们。后退、格挡和/或护盾，你就会没事。不要四处奔跑，后退不要伤害你的团队。





### 守护者

> Guardian


** 守护构造体 **

一份价格，三个头目！还记得在暗影洞穴I中那个拥有三个不同阶段的首领吗？现在你要同时对抗三个不同阶段，它们是三个单独的目标！

这需要沟通和对不同结构的机制的认识。它们共享一个生命条，所以你先杀哪个并不重要。但是，如果你能偶尔叠放它们，它们会受到额外的伤害。你攻击的每一个结构都会对承受的总伤害做出贡献。然而，这并不像听起来那么简单，因为它们中的一个可能会变得非常凶猛。

* **蓝色首领** :  这个首领在大部分的战斗中会保持相对静止的状态，如果坦克可以嘲讽它并让其减益那就最好不过了，但有时这是不可能的，所以不要惊慌。这个首领会将他的大炮瞄向空中并造成闪电冲击落在地面上，你只需要留意自己的脚下，及时远离它们即可避免受到伤害。你不需要像疯狂的奔跑一样四处乱窜，只需要在每次闪电从天而降时稍微移动一下，避免它命中你即可。

* **黄色首领** :  如果玩家低估它或开始变得自私并对其他人出手，这个首领可能会成为一场噩梦。这个首领可以被嘲讽，只要坦克不放弃嘲讽，它就会跟随坦克。它的重击被称为“斩首”。这是一个锥形范围伤害，如果没有坦克，被任何困在其中的人都会几乎立即死亡。您可以阻挡它，也可以向后闪避翻滚，但不要闪避或者朝着您的团队方向奔跑。这可以击中范围内的许多人，并且范围伤害将会随着您的翻滚移动而跟随您。不要将首领转向您的朋友。这个首领还偶尔会试图治疗其他敌人。有些团队喜欢将这个首领带到房间的一侧，而其他敌人则在其他一侧被处理。但如果您是一名强大的坦克，您可以将其堆叠在蓝色首领之上。

* **红色BOSS** :  这是一个有趣的BOSS。你可以用一个debuff来嘲讽他，但当他旋转时，不能用嘲讽来吸引仇恨。这个BOSS会选择目标并像疯子一样追逐他们旋转。如果你被旋转夹住，你会被缚住，并接受快速的高物理伤害，会非常快地死亡。如果这个BOSS盯上你了，把他引开，然后在一个圆圈里奔跑，直到他停下来。你可以在伤害区域中拉BOSS做环形移动（在AOE中可以造成额外伤害），但不能以牺牲你的团队为代价，不要在你自己的团队中公共交通列车。

祝你好运！

> ** DESERT LION **
> 
> This boss is very easy as most first bosses are but you must be careful with your resources. There is a main boss (Desert Lion) and 4x lioness adds. The tank should grab the adds as soon as possible and stack them on the boss. If you are a dps or healer do NOT run around the room because a lion is trying to eat you, just get close to the tank so he/she can gain agro. The adds will die to aoe quickly as they are low health and then you can focus the boss.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is a very simple and common mechanic from most bosses. A typical heavy attack which must be blocked or you will be knocked down. Whether you are a Tank or not, if this is aimed at you...you MUST block it.
> 
> **Roar** - Occasionally the boss will change positions making the fight a little bit mobile and also he will ROAR! This does exactly what you would expect a lion's roar to do, and it FEARS the group. You will run a random direction uncontrollable for about 3 seconds and he WILL jump someone in the back. SO as soon as you see this mechanic make sure you break free and get back into position. This is why you should keep an eye on your resources. Make sure you have enough stamina at all times to break free if and when you need to.
> 
> During the fight the dps and the healer should position themselves away from the front of the boss and for the most part stand still. There is no other dangerous mechanics happening. Tank needs to hold a taunt and the group should burn the boss as best they can

> This boss is a tricky one. He has 3 phases! Phase one he is a melee type with a two hander, phase two he is a mage with lots of fire damage, and then finally he calls down a gargoyle to finish you off!
> 
> The initial approach to the fight can be rough as there are many adds to kill and he jumps in mid fight. So make sure your tank holds everything central while the dps focus on as much aoe as possible. The tank needs to be quick off the mark however in order to taunt the boss when he lands in the
> 
> **Phase 1** - Warrior - The boss will heavy attack with his two handed weapon at whoever has agro. This should be the tank since the tank is the one with the taunt, however if you are a dps or healer do NOT panic and do NOT run away. Simply block and you will be fine. But if you miss it then it will knock you down.
> 
> Occasionally he will also do a whirlwind like attack spinning his weapon around his head. As a dps or healer you MUST stay out of this as it deals a LOT of physical damage. No need to run around, just move out of it and wait for it to finish.
> 
> **Phase 2** - Mage - The boss will alter completely now using a flame staff. He throws out constantly light attacks in the form of a fire ball and the tank should be the only one getting hit so long as he/she is maintaining a taunt. If you get agro as a dps or healer just block until agro is regained and you will be fine.
> 
> His heavy attack will put a LARGE fire aoe on the ground, stay OUT of this. This will kill you rapidly so just watch your feet. Also finally the boss will cast a flame spirit affect on the tank fearing it. So if you are the tank keep enough stamina in your pool so that you can break free when this happens.
> 
> **Phase 3** - Gargoyle - As the boss is about to die he will call down a monstrous gargoyle. He is not as scary as he looks. Get your tank to position him in the middle of the room, while the dps and healer find a nice safe spot to do their job without running away or around. The gargoyle will attack the tank (or whoever has agro) with a flurry attack. Most tanks will be able to stand up to this but if not simply block, same goes for other roles too, blocking is fine.
> 
> The gargoyle will breath on a random player (do NOT stack up) and turn them to stone. This can be broken free from so be sure to have enough stamina at all times in case YOU are the target. After the first breath he will slam the ground like crazy and you MUST get out of it until he has finished. Then the fight repeats making it so he flurries, does 2x breaths then a slam. Rinse repeat. Keep out of his face if you are a dps/healer and you will be fine.
> 
> Remember to step OUT of the slam.

> Boilbite
> 
> 
> ** BOILBITE **
> 
> This boss is simple but can hit like a STREAM TRAIN. Firstly there are 4 adds, the tank should stack these on the boss and each other member of the group should find a nice position around the boss where they are not in his face. The adds will die to aoe damage as they are very weak. Now it is time to focus the boss damage wise and pay attention!
> 
> **Teleport** - Just like assassin beetles this boss can teleport, be careful and be sure to block when this happens and get ready to move. the initial hit hurts but he usually follows it up with his next attack.
> 
> **Fire Blast** - The boss will stop in his tracks and a spreading aoe will grow from underneath him.
> 
> Unlike most spreading aoes this does NOT just cause damage when it explodes. This actually pules fire damage every second until it explodes at maximum size. If you do NOT get out of this as a dps or a healer you are dead. It hits incredibly hard and you must get out of it as soon as possible. The tank should be able to stand up to it but the rest will not.
> 
> Once this mechanic is over, get back in position and continue to attack. Rinse repeat until the fight is over.
> 
> A very simple fight for sure but devastating if you do it wrong.

> Tremorscale

> 
> ** TREMORSCALE **
> 
> This boss is a lot easy to kill than he looks and has some very basic, easy to avoid attacks. He doesn't even hit that hard to be honest but of course it is always safer to follow the mechanics.
> 
> **Tail Whip** - occasionally the boss will put out a ROAR and turn to his side. When he does this a cone aoe will happen and he will whip his tail. This will be in the direction of the tank or whoever has agro. You have two options here, block it, or move out of it. Either option is fine but if you fail it you will be knocked down on the ground.
> 
> **Burrow** - This mechanic is actually quite fun. The boss will burrow into the ground and randomly choose a victim. Whoever he has chose will have an erupting aoe appear under them and he will burst out of the ground doing damage to anyone caught in the aoe. This doesn't hurt very much really but you should dodgeroll or run out of it as soon as this happens and then get back into position.
> 
> The tank should always be in the bosses face and the dps/healer should always be behind/beside the boss.
> 
> Do not run around the room else the burrow mechanic can get a bit hectic. Relax, get out of danger, then get back into position.

> Unstable Construct

> 
> ** UNSTABLE CONSTRUCT **
> 
> This boss is a little tricky. The room is small and he attacks FAST. The tank should hold the boss and the adds all together while the group find a nice position for their feet without running around.
> 
> **lightning** - The boss ire a lightning shot along the floor. You will see a small circle aoe aiming at you or another member of the group, you CAN block this but it is safer to just move to one side and let it pass.
> 
> **Spin** - This attack is done on the spot, he will stand still and spin his torso. This does cause nasty physical damage but if you are about 3-5meters out of range OR blocking you will be just fine.
> 
> **Slam**  - During the fight the boss will go into a ball shape and jump in the air slamming the ground. There will be a small aoe under his feet so stay out of it. Very simple to avoid this one as it is only about 3 meters wide.
> 
> **Bomb** - one member of the group occasionally will get a large aoe under their feet. This is a bomb and if you run into the group you will blow them up. Step back, block and/or shield and you will be fine. DO NOT run around, step back so you do not kill your group.

> Three bosses for the price of one! Remember the boss in Darkshade caverns I where he had 3 different phases? well NOW you are fighting all 3 phases at once as 3 individual targets!
> 
> This requires communication and awareness of the mechanics of the different constructs. They share a health bar so it doesn't matter which one you kill first. However if you can manage to stack them occasionally, they will take additional damage. Each one you are hitting contributes to the overall damage being taken. However that is not as simple as it sounds because one of them can go completely rouge.
> 
> **Blue Boss** - This one will stay fairly still for the majority of the fight, if the tank can taunt it for a debuff that would be preferable but sometimes that is not possible so do not panic. This boss will aim his cannon into the air and cause lightning blasts to land on the ground, just watch your feet and move away from them before they land and you will be fine. you do not have to sprint around like mad, just move a bit each time one is coming down from the sky and prevent it from hitting you.
> 
> **Yellow Boss** - This one can be a nightmare if people underestimate it or get selfish and start running at their team. This CAN be taunted and will follow the tank so long as the tank does not drop the taunt. This one has a heavy attack called'decapitate'. It is a cone aoe in front of him and anyone caught in it, if not a tank, will die in pretty much one shot. You can block it and you can dodge roll backwards but do NOT dodge or run in the direction of your team. This can hit as many people as it can hit in the aoe and the aoe follows you when you dodge roll. DON'T spin the boss onto your friends. This boss will also occasionally try to heal the others. Some groups like to take this boss to one side of the room while the others are being dealt with. But if you are a strong tank, you can stack it on top of the blue one.
> 
> **?Red Boss** - This is the fun one. He can be taunted with a debuff but he cannot be taunted to gain agro when he is spinning. This boss will decide on a target and chase them spinning like mad. If you are caught in the spin you will be snared and take rapid high physical damage ticks and die incredibly fast. if this boss is on you, take him away and run in a circle until he stops. You can kite him around where the damage is being done(in aoes for extra damage) BUT not at the expense of your group, do not choo choo train through your own group.
