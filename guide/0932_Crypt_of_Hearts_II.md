## 心灵地穴 II

> Crypt of Hearts II




### 伊贝尔加斯特

> Ibelgast


在心灵地穴 II 中，你会遇到名为伊贝尔加斯特的 boss。

这个Boss非常简单。Boss在战斗中会不断召唤小兵，因此坦克需要跟随Boss，但当它们加入战斗时，坦克必须能够抓住它们。然而，小兵的数量基于Boss的生命值，所以越快杀死Boss，小兵就越快生成。因此，不要在房间里跳舞，否则局面会很快混乱。坦克应尽可能将Boss保持在中心，以保持控制，并在真正危险时避免引起人群的恐慌。

* **小怪** :  在整个战斗过程中会出现小怪，必须处理掉。坦克应该尝试嘲讽/链引尽可能多的小怪，而团队则应专注于打断首领的技能。如果你的输出很高，你可以用AOE攻击杀死所有小怪，但如果团队伤害不足，你可以专注于治疗，并在处理完治疗后回到攻击首领。但要小心首领血量降低的时候，因为一个大型肉体元素将会从传送门中出现加入战斗，需要重点攻击它。它的血量不高，但它有一个危险的重击需要格挡。

* **AOE圆形范围攻击** :  Boss将随机选择一个目标，在该目标脚下放置一个大圆形AOE。如果是你，只需要简单地躲开它即可。它非常容易看到并且不会移动，所以不要惊慌，只需向一侧移动并继续进行攻击即可。

* **重攻击** :  这个攻击很简单，Boss会开始一个巨大的重攻击，并加上击退效果。无论你是不是坦克，如果这攻击瞄准了你，你需要*必须*格挡。这个攻击只会瞄准当前仇恨最高的人，所以如果它瞄准了一个DPS或者治疗，那么坦克的死角露出来了！





### 鲁索祖扎帕玛

> Ruzozuzalpamaz


** 鲁索祖扎帕玛 ** 

这是 Elder Scrolls Online 中的一个特定BOSS名字。

这是一个简单的攻略，但需要一些协调和放松，不要惊慌失措地在房间里乱跑，因为那会导致全军覆没。关注和注意机制，你就不会有问题。坦克应该把BOSS固定在房间中央，团队应该环绕她。不要在彼此的脚下叠加，要分散站立。开始时保持静止。

* **追踪AOE** :  在战斗中，首领会随机选择一个玩家。一个巨大的AOE会开始追踪这个玩家。对付这个技能的诀窍是进行拉怪。如果您不熟悉此技术，不要担心，基本上意味着不断移动。因此，如果您是目标，请让您的队伍知道这一点，向外围步进来，然后在房间里大环绕，避免它，等它消失后回到您的位置。只要您不跑得太远，仍然可以造成伤害和/或接受治疗。只需确保不要重叠AOE到团队上即可。您掌控着它，所以如果它杀死了您的队友，那是您没有正确掌控它。放松，做一个大圆圈，回来就可以了。

* **蜘蛛** :  整个战斗过程中会一直刷出大量的蜘蛛。在这时恐慌是没有帮助的。保持阵地，让蜘蛛靠近中间。坦克可以将它们连成一串。嘲讽和钉住它们等等，但是如果你在被蜘蛛盯住时开始在房间里乱跑，控制它们会变得非常困难。所以让坦克完成他们的工作，放松，让蜘蛛进来，尽量进行AOE伤害。它们的生命值并不高，所以并不难打败，但是如果人们开始跳迪斯科舞，情况会变得非常混乱。记住，如果你被某些东西盯上，它会一直追随你直到你死亡，所以停止逃跑并把它交给坦克！

* **重击** :  这很简单，她偶尔会进行重击，需要格挡。即使你是一个DPS或治疗者，如果她攻击你，一定要格挡，否则你会遭受到一个严重的击退并使战斗变得有些混乱。

* **茧** :  在战斗中，首领会随机用蛛网茧包裹住小队的成员！这非常关键，因为被包裹住的人可能是坦克、治疗或输出，甚至是那个当前受到“追踪aoe”的人...被蛛网包裹并受到追踪aoe的攻击，你将会死亡。

这是你的团队需要集中注意力的时候。如果有人被包围了，你的团队需要立刻跑过去按合作键来释放他们！这是最关键的机制。如果坦克没有被释放，那么BOSS会脱离嘲讽并且会杀死所有人，如果治疗被包围，那么没有人能够获得治疗，你明白了吧！





### 房间守护者

> Chamber Guardian


【攻略翻译】
** 圆厅守卫 **

这个首领在副本中是最容易的之一，但是根据团队的经验可能会变得混乱。坦克应该抓住首领并将其保持在房间的中央。尽可能保持它静止，以不影响地面上可能造成伤害的Aoe技能。

* **重击** :  这里很简单，谁拥有仇恨（应该是坦克）将偶尔会受到重击！与游戏中的其他重击一样，这需要格挡！请注意防御。

* **骷髅** :  战斗期间会有骷髅刷新，这些需要快速消灭，否则他们会不断刷新，压倒你。坦克可以控制它们，使用低到中等的范围伤害消灭它们，但是如果你的小队总体伤害不足，应尽快将它们集中攻击。

* **恐惧** :  这个boss会在整个战斗中召唤灵魂（非常频繁）来使整个小组感到恐惧。你必须尽快打破恐惧状态。很多时候，恐惧状态会被一次重击紧随其后，如果你不能及时打破恐惧状态，那么你将会受到重创。由于这个boss是近战型的，当玩家逃跑时他当然会追击，所以如果你无法及时打破恐惧状态，他将在一段长距离内旅行，并脱离你的伤害范围。这对整个战斗是不利的，因为现在dps必须重新应用技能，战斗时间变长。关键点基本上是，让他保持静止，然后尽快打破恐惧状态，这样你就不会让他在房间里乱跑。他想在房间里乱跑...不要让他这样做！





### Crypt of Hearts II的翻译是“心灵地穴 II”。

> Illambris Amalgam


**伊拉姆布里斯混合体**

这个首领看起来比实际还要凶恶。首先，你会被伊兰布里斯双子所迎接，杀死其中一个将导致他们消失并从地面上的堆召唤出首领。不要惊慌。组成一个漂亮的圆圈，确保坦克获得了首领的攻击并使其保持静止在堆上。绝对不要移动首领。

* **骷髅** :  和大多数骨制巨人一样，首领会不时召唤出三个近战骷髅，它们的血量非常低，AOE技能很容易将它们消灭，即使伤害很低也能轻松搞定。但坦克可以通过龙爪/固定技能/状态效果来控制它们，也可以嘲讽它们。只需让它们静止不动即可，无需四处奔波。

* **更大的骷髅** :  偶尔会有另一批小怪刷新进入战斗。这些骷髅的生命值比基础骷髅要高得多。然而，就像基础骷髅一样，这些骷髅可以被坦克嘲讽和控制。不要在房间里乱跑，否则它们会杀死你。它们很容易受到范围伤害和/或终极技能的打击，但如果你逃跑，几乎无法控制它们。靠近首领并继续做你正在做的事情。

* **跺脚** :  首领偶尔会跺脚，当发生这种情况时，只需走开或格挡。格挡将消除大部分伤害，因此可能更安全。

* **火雨** :  当BOSS的生命值很低时，它会愤怒并不断在小组周围的地面上降下火雨。你只需要在每次下落前站到一侧即可。不要停留在地上，杀死BOSS即可。顺便说一句，如果你的小组中有新星技能，则可以非常方便地解决这一难关。





### 梅泽露丝

> Mezeluth


**梅泽露丝(Mezeluth)**

这个Boss是我喜欢称之为“杀PUG的凶手”，因为它确实如此。由于他们无法协调，很多人放弃了这个低血量堆栈和烧伤节日。这里是如何避免这些情况...学习机械结构。对于这个战斗，当然，坦克需要嘲讽BOSS并始终保持仇恨，但最重要的是，位置是关键！

把房间看作一个钟表。你有4个玩家。每个玩家分别站在钟表上的四分之一处。因此，人们站在12点、3点、6点和9点的位置。不要从这些位置移动。每个人都应该拥有自己的四分之一的位置！如果不这样做，结果会导致全灭和/或愚蠢的死亡。

* **上古卷轴在线游戏攻略

地面之火** :  Boss 经常会把她的法杖举起来释放技能，这会在她选择的目标下放置一个恶心的范围伤害，并使位置难以确定，所以当你看到这个技能时一定要打断她，可以用巴掌攻击或其他能打断技能。不要依赖其他玩家来做这件事，每个玩家都可以打断目标(在教程的3级前就学过这个技能)。

* **灭团技能** :  其实这个技能没有正式的名称，但我喜欢称它为“灭团技能”，因为通常会发生这样的事情。首领会使用吸入机制并将所有人吸到空中。在你的脚下会出现一个扩散的aoe，它会跟随着你。在这个阶段，每个玩家的后方会出现一个松散的aoe！

这就是为什么你必须处于四分之一时钟的阵型中的原因。每个玩家应该旋转他们的相机，然后闪避回到他们自己时钟的四分之一区域，并避免落在他们一侧的地面AOE上，避免与其他玩家重叠。如果你的身体与另一个AOE重叠，当它们爆炸时，你会死亡。

因此，简要概括一下......被吸入的机制，旋转相机，向后看，闪避滚动回到你的区域，并避免地面AOE（和其他玩家），然后让爆炸发生。

这个任务非常简单，但如果有一个人做错了，你们会遇到很大的麻烦！





### 奈恩斯

> Nerien'eth


** 奈恩斯 **

《上古卷轴在线》游戏攻略：
心灵地穴 II 的最终首领变得并不像以前那么难了，但它仍然相当棘手，需要协调配合。对于低 cps 的玩家或者不注意的人来说，这里有许多几乎是一击必杀的机制，所以你必须睁大眼睛。尽管首领已经被挑衅，但有一些机制是随机的，所以每个人都必须保持警惕。坦克需要始终在首领身上保持嘲讽，而团队应该在首领周围形成一个漂亮的圆圈，以避免叠加在一起，如果叠加在一起，就会出现问题，因为随机选定的玩家无法确定谁是目标。所以要给彼此一些空间（这并不意味着在房间里狂奔）。

* **巫妖水晶** :  当首领举起手时，他会在房间周围生成巫妖水晶。一条链将从地面伸出，然后从水晶中爆发出一个大型范围攻击。这些非常容易避免，只需远离范围攻击即可。虽然它们看起来很可怕，但只要避开它们，它们就不会对你造成伤害。

* **飞行骷髅** :  在战斗中boss会偶尔选择一个随机玩家作为目标。他会开始施展技能，然后向他所选择的玩家发射飞向的骷髅。我在开头提到玩家需要拥有自己的空间，就是为了应对这个机制。如果施展技能时他盯着你看，那么你就是目标，你需要做好准备。一旦它开始朝你飞来，就要躲开。如果没有躲开，就会受到巨大的伤害并倒地。低CP的玩家或输出高但防御低的玩家会立即被击杀，所以一定要躲开骷髅。分散位置以便观察目标玩家是谁！

* **cffff00瞬移爆炸** :  Boss 会不时地在随机玩家处瞬移，当这种情况发生时，您必须尽快躲开他！无论他降落在哪里，他都会从脚底下施放一个巨大的扩散AOE在地面上。如果你太慢，单个闪避无法覆盖足够的范围。如果被此攻击命中，除非你相对坦克（在这种情况下你会被命中并击倒），否则你基本上一枪毙命。所以，如果他瞬移了，赶紧离开！

* **鬼魂** :  在地图上有三个带有烤架的“井”状物。当BOSS传送到其中之一时，他会释放两个鬼魂。每次无论他去哪个，都会有两个更多。如果你只是为了完成，快点杀死它们，因为你会被压垮。如果你想挑战困难模式（仅限兽人）你必须保持这些鬼魂的存活。坦克应该吸引鬼魂注意力，队员们不应该对它们造成伤害。为了完成困难模式，你必须在BOSS拔出剑之前（35%血量）让4个鬼魂存活！

如果你的团队有很高的伤害，请在4个鬼魂出现之前节制伤害，小心不要杀死它们得太早。

* **拿剑** :  当首领的生命值降至35%时，它会伸手拿取房间中央的剑。这就是“行动时间”！这是你可以击杀幽灵（如果要进行困难模式）的时机，也是团队需要集中注意力并靠近首领的时候。坦克应该继续嘲讽，而团队应该在首领周围形成一个紧密的圆圈。不要跑来跑去。

当Boss拿起剑时，全组将被震慑。然后Boss会选择一名随机玩家悬浮在空中并试图吸取他们的能量。被选择的玩家必须协同反抗Boss的吸取，同一时间，全组必须尽可能多地攻击Boss，以消除Boss的新伤害护盾并让被选中的玩家安全落地。

一旦玩家被释放后，可以通过逗引控制老板，但他现在会用剑进行高伤害的近战攻击，并随机攻击玩家，进行冲锋。因此，保持在一个圈内，如果他瞄准你，请确保进行格挡。

如果他还活着一段时间，他会用一个伤害护盾再次循环吸收阶段。此时，只需要重复这个过程。不要惊慌，祝你好运！

> This boss is very simple. The boss spawns adds through out the fight so the tank will need to keep with the boss but of course be able to grab them as and when they enter the fight. They are based on health however so the faster the burn the faster they spawn. So do NOT dance around the room or this will get messy quickly. The tank should try to hold the boss as central as possible to keep control and avoid panicking people when it really hits the fan.
> 
> **Adds** - Throughout the fight adds will spawn and these must be dealt with, the tank should try to taunt/chain as many in as possible while the group try to focus interrupting the boss. If you have high dps you can pretty much kill all of the adds with aoe, but if your group damage is suffering you can FOCUS the healers and then go back to the boss. Be careful at low health of the boss however because a large flesh Atronach will come out of a portal to join the fight and he will need to be focused. His health isn't high but he does have a nasty heavy attack which will need to be blocked if targeted.
> 
> **AOE Circle** - The boss will randomly choose a target to place a LARGE circular aoe on the floor under them. If this is you simple move out of it. It is extremely easy to see and doesn't move, so don't panic, just move to the side and carry on as you were.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This doesn't get much simpler, the boss will wind up a HUGE heavy attack with a knock back added to it. Whether you are the tank or not, if this aims at YOU, you *must* block it! This will only aim at the person with agro, so if it is aimed at a dps or healer, the tank dropped the ball!

> 
> This is a simple one but does require some co-ordination and for people to relax and not panic running around the room UN-necessarily because that WILL cause a wipe. Focus and pay attention to the mechanics and you won't have a problem. The tank should hold the boss in the middle of the room and the group should surround her. Do NOT stack on each others feet. Spread out and stand still to start with.
> 
> **Chasing Aoe** - During the fight the boss will pick a player at random. A massive aoe will start chasing them. The trick to this is kiting. If you are not familiar with this do not worry, basically it means keep moving. So, if YOU are the target, let your group know it is you, step back about to the outer circle of your group and simple run around the room in a large circle to avoid it, and when it has gone come back into your position. So long as you don't run too far away you can still do damage and/or take heals. Just be sure you do not overlap the aoe onto the group. YOU are in control of it, so it if kills your team mates, YOU didn't control it properly. Relax, BIG circle, get back in...easy.
> 
> **?Spiders** - Throughout the fight swarms of spiders will spawn. This is when panicking does NOT help. Stay in position, let  the spiders come to the middle. The tank can chain them. taunt them and pin them etc but if you start running around the room when you have agro they are incredibly difficult to control. So let the tank do their job, relax, let the spiders come in and get as much aoe damage down as possible. They do not have a lot of health so are not hard to kill, but it can get messy if people start disco dancing. Remember if you have agro on something, it will chase you until you are dead, so stop running away and take it to the tank!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is pretty simple stuff, she occasionally heavy attacks and this needs to be blocked. Even if you are a dps or a healer, if she is on you, be sure to block this, or you will get a nasty knock back and can make the fight a bit messy.
> 
> **Cocoon!** - During the fight the boss will randomly wrap up a member of the group in a web cocoon! This is crucial as it could be the tank, the healer, OR the dps and even a person who currently has the 'Chasing aoe'...Wrapped up in a web AND a chasing aoe is you dead.
> 
> This is when your group has to pay full attention. If anyone is in a cocoon this is when your group needs to run over to them and hit the synergy button to release them ASAP! This is a key mechanic above all. If the tank doesn't get freed, the boss taunt will fall off and she will kill everyone, if the healer is cocooned then no one gets heals, you get the idea!

> This boss is one of the easiest in the dungeon honestly BUT can get messy depending on the group's experience. The tank should grab the boss and simply hold it in the middle of the room. Try to keep it as still as possible to not remove him from possible dps aoes on the floor.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Pretty simple stuff here, whoever has agro (should be the tank) will occasionally get heavy attacked! As with every other heavy attack in the game, this needs to be BLOCKED!
> 
> **Skeletons** - Throughout the fight skeletons will spawn, these need to be killed quickly else they can overwhelm you with multiple spawns. They can be controlled by the tank and killed with low to mid aoe damage, BUT if your group is lacking damage overall, focus these down as soon as possible.
> 
> **Fear** - The boss will invoke a spirit throughout the fight (very often) to fear the group. You must break free as soon as possible. A lot of the time the fear is followed by a heavy attack so if you don't break free fast enough it will hurt. With the boss being melee based he will of course chase people to their feet when they run away, so if you take TOO long to break free, he will travel a long distance and leave your damage aoes. This is negative to the fight because now the dps have to reapply skills and the fight takes longer. Key points basically are, hold him still, and break free fast so you don't run him around the room. He WANTS to run around the room...don't let him!

> This boss is pretty looks worst than he is. To start with you will be greeted by the Ilambris twins, Killing ONE of them will result in them disappearing and spawning the boss from the pile on the ground. Do NOT panic. Get in a nice circle, make sure the tank has the agro of the boss and holds him STILL on the pile. NEVER move the boss.
> 
> **Skeletons** - As with most Bone Colossus types the boss will spawn 3 melee skeletons from time to time, these are very low health and aoe will kill them pretty fast, even low damage. But the tank CAN control these with talons/immobilize abilities/status effects and also taunt them. Simply hold them still, no need to run around.
> 
> **Larger skeletons** - Another spawn of adds will come into the fight occasionally. These have a fair amount more health than the basic skeletons. However, just like the basic ones, these can be taunted and controlled by the tank. Do NOT run around the room else these will kill you. They can die easily to aoe damage and/or ultimates but if you run, it is almost impossible to control. Stay near the boss and keep doing what you are doing.
> 
> **Stomp** - The boss will occasionally stomp the ground, when this happens, simply step out of it or block. Blocking will negate a HUGE proportion of the damage so is probably safer.
> 
> **Rain of Fire** - Low health the boss will enrage and constantly rain fire on the ground around the group. All you need to do here is step to one side before each one lands. Watch your feet and kill the boss. Nova helps a LOT for this by the way if you have this available in your group.

> This boss is what i like to call the 'P.U.G killer' because that is exactly what it does. So many people quit on this low health stack and burn fest due to them not being able to co-ordinate. And here is how you avoid those situations...learning the mechanics. For this fight, of course the tank needs to be taunting the boss and keep agro at all times but above all, positioning is KEY!
> 
> Look at the room as a clock face. You have 4 players. EACH player takes quarter of the clock. So, people stand at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 9 o'clock. DO NOT move from these positions. everyone should have their OWN quarter of the clock! failure to do this WILL result in a wipe and/or silly deaths.
> 
> **Ground Fire** - very so often the boss put her staff in the air channeling an ability, this will place a nasty aoe under the target of her choice and makes positioning difficult, so be sure when you see this to INTERRUPT her either with a bash or a skill that does such. Do not rely on everyone else to do it, EVERY player can interrupt targets (you were taught this at before level 3 in the tutorial).
> 
> **The Wipe** - This ability does have a name as such but i like to call it 'The Wipe' because that is what usually happens. The boss will do a suck in mechanic and pull everyone to her feet in mid air. A spreading aoe will appear under your feet and attach itself to you. Yes that means it follows YOU. During this phase an aoe will appear loosely behind each player!
> 
> THIS is why you must be in the quarter clock formation. EACH player should spin their camera, and dodge roll back into THEIR quarter of the clock and AVOID landing in the ground aoe on their side and AVOID all other players. If your body overlaps another aoe, when they explode. You will DIE.
> 
> So to recap...suck in mechanic, spin your camera, look behind you, dodge roll BACK into YOUR quarter and avoid the ground aoe (and other players) and let the explosion happen.
> 
> It is very simple but if one person does it wrong, you are gonna have a really rough time!

> The final boss in Crypt of hearts II is not as hard as it once was, but it is still pretty tricky and requires co-ordination. There are many almost one shot mechanics in here for people with lower cps or for people not paying attention so you must keep your eyes open. The boss although taunted has SOME mechanics which are random. So everyone must be on their toes. The tank needs to keep a taunt on the boss at all times and the group should be in a nice circle around the boss as not to stack, if you stack it becomes a problem because random targeted players cannot tell WHO is the target. So give each other some room (that doesn't mean sprint around the room).
> 
> **Lich Crystals** - The boss will raise his hand in the air, when he does this he will spawn lich crystals around the room. A chain will come out of the ground and then a big aoe burst will come from them. These are extremely easy to avoid, simply step out of the aoe. There are many of them so it does look scary but just stay out of them and they wont harm you.
> 
> **Flying Skull** - Occasionally during the fight the boss will target a random player. He will start channeling  for a brief moment and then let rip with a projectile flying skull at the player of his choice. The reason i stated at the beginning that players need to have their own space is for THIS mechanic. If while channeling he is looking at YOU, then YOU are the target and you need to prepare for it. Once it starts flying at you, dodge roll it. Failure to do so will result in MASSIVE damage and a knock down. Low cp players or glass cannons will take a one shot from this and die, so do NOT miss the dodge roll. Spread out so you can see who the target is!
> 
> |cffff00Teleport Blast - The boss will teleport from time to time at a random player, when this happens you must get away from him ASAP! Where ever he lands he will cast a massive spreading AOE on the ground from his feet. It is large enough for a single dodge roll to not be enough if you are too slow. If this hits you, unless you are fairly tanky OR the tank (in which case you will get hit and knocked down) you are pretty much dead in one shot. So, if he teleports, GTFO!
> 
> **Ghosts** - There are 3 'well' type places on the map with a grill over them. When the boss teleports to these he will release two ghosts. Every time regardless of which one he goes to will be two more. IF you are just going for a completion, kill these fast as you will get overwhelmed. If you are going for hardmode (vet only) you MUST keep these alive. The tank should take the ghosts away and people should NOT be damaging them. In order to complete hard mode you MUST have 4 ghosts alive when the boss reaches for the sword! (35% health).
> 
> Hold back on the damage until 4 ghosts are present if your group has a lot of high damage. Be careful not to kill them too early.
> 
> **Taking The sword!** - At 35% health the boss will reach for the sword in the center of the room. This is 'go time!'. This is when you can kill the ghosts (if going for hard mode) and also when the group needs to focus and staying close to the boss. The tank should hold the taunt and the group should have a tight circle close to the boss. Do NOT run around the room.
> 
> When the boss grabs the sword the group will be stunned. The boss will then choose a random player in the group and hold him/her in mid air and try to drain them. The player in question must synergies to resist the drain and at the same time the group must do as much damage as possible to remove the new damage shield from the boss and drop the player to safety.
> 
> Once the player has been released, the boss can be controlled with a taunt but he will now fight with the sword doing HIGH melee damage and randomly attack players with a charge attack. So, stay in a circle, and if he aims at YOU, be sure to block.
> 
> If he is still alive for a while he will recycle the drain phase with a damage shield. At this stage, it is rinse repeat. Do not panic and good luck!!
