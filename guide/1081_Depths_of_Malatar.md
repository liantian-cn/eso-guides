## 马拉塔深渊

> Depths of Malatar




### 拾荒饿鬼

> The Scavenging Maw


**垃圾食客之喉**

这可能很简单，也可能一团糟！这需要一些协调和尽量少的恐慌。听起来很容易，对吧？事实上，对于大多数无组游戏（PUGS）玩家来说，这与该Boss的设计完全相反。对于缺乏经验的玩家来说，这个Boss可能会让人害怕，所以如果你不喜欢恐怖电影，最好别碰。坦克需要集中注意力，非常小心地调整位置，不要放弃嘲讽，最重要的是，集体在机制期间保持在一起。《史酷比》（Scooby Doo）通常是对的，分开寻找坏人是一个坏主意（你会明白为什么）！
注：无法翻译" PUGS"“.”之后缺少主语。

* **呼吸** :  正如Hunger类型的敌人所期望的那样，这个boss确实有一个令人讨厌的锥形前冲攻击。这会造成持续的高伤害，需要避开。如果你是DPS或治疗，如果你站在这里，你会死的。坦克必须试图让boss面对着团队，并阻挡这个攻击，同时保持自己的生命。如果你跑来跑去，这个攻击会跟着你，你最终会让团队遭受攻击，然后全部死亡。你必须保持嘲讽并将其远离团队。如果boss因任何原因失去控制，而你作为DPS/治疗人员站在里面，你存活的最好选择是通过闪避在boss身上来将其带回到坦克身上，以便他们恢复。但通常情况下，如果这个机制没有得到控制，你就会死亡。

* **喷吐** :  首领向坦克（或者当前仇恨目标）吐出一种恶臭的毒液。当这个命中时，任何站在其中的人都会承受巨大的持续性伤害。大多数的坦克都无法承受这种攻击。

不要忘记这个Boss实际上会发射两次！所以当它落地时，与Boss保持距离后向后退，并在第二次降落时做同样的事情（向后走）。一旦你脱离了这两个AOE，你就会安全了。DPS（输出）、治疗师应该跟随坦克的路径，但不要站在傻瓜的位置，否则你会死！

* **重击** :  Boss会发动重击，如果团队坦克能够成功格挡，就能防护此次攻击。若避免不及，将被击倒并且很可能会死亡。请务必小心。

* **暗影跳跃** :  老板会消失在空中并释放一个重型攻击机制（白色火花），瞄准团队，以玩家脚下的扩散AOE表示。当AOE到达顶峰并且他即将攻击时，请闪避躲开，您就能幸存下来。如果您没有躲开，您将被击杀！

* **捉迷藏** :  这是让每个人都惊恐的机制。你在一个类似仓库的可怕房间里，面对着一个隐形的食欲魔。

根据血量变化，这将发生，每个阶段你都需要以相同的方式完成这个阶段。

这将在80％，50％和最后25％发生！

首领会消失，你需要找到他，但是地面上会出现AOE，你必须避免（以扩散的AOE形式出现，之后将出现图腾）。小怪会出现（多达3个饥饿者），需要消灭，如果你发现了首领......找到他的人将会被吸干并钉在地上。

这是最重要的一点……让你的坦克成为队伍的领导，并且每个人都必须保持在一起！如果分开，那么一个人会被孤独地留下，如果他们意外地触发了BOSS，他们将被吃掉并在黑暗中死亡！

当有人找到首领时，您必须打断首领的攻击，使其离开你的队友，然后继续以上的机制来进行战斗。

关键点：团结在一起，击杀小兵，避开范围伤害，当老板跳出来并固定任何发现他的人时进行打断。如果你遵循这些步骤，你就会没事。如果不遵守，就会成为你自己的恐怖故事！ 

（注意：未翻译The Weeping Woman，Ghost，Tharayya，Ven，En，Mor，King Narilmor，Ri，Arrow Spray，Ghost，The Weeping Woman，Nari和Fang Lair包含在已知专有名词中，不需要翻译。而Meteor可以直接翻译为"流星"）





### 悲泣之女

> The Weeping Woman


**悲泣之女**

这场战斗其实非常直接，但如果人们不注意或过于自信，情况会变得非常混乱。如果你试图用AOE攻击这个BOSS但你的攻击力不够好，你会被大量怪物淹没，而这些怪物可不是好对付的。它们可以对一个DPS造成重击而一击必杀，甚至可以轻易一击必杀一个坦克！所以，要注意机制，看着自己的脚，尽量不要炫耀过度。大多数随机匹配的玩家会因为这些问题而失败并愤怒地离开。

* **间歇泉** :  这是一个典型的Nerid/leminid类型的机制，如果你看过Scaelcaller，应该会很熟悉。多个间歇泉会从地面喷出。如果你被击中，你会悬空并受到巨大的伤害。注意脚下，不要站在这些泉水里！

* **冰冻** :  这非常容易看到。你会在房间里看到两种AOE攻击，看起来像大旋转的冰特效。根据下面每种类型的描述避免它们并且在生命值低时你将同时遭受两种攻击！外部AOE：这是一个大圆圈，围绕在房间外部，你需要通过呆在房间中间来避免受到伤害。

范围攻击范围内：这与上述的情况相同，只是不在房间外部，而是在中间！简单来说，就是反其道而行之，待在房间外部。

AOE攻击：当你的生命值较低时，你将遭受两个AOE攻击，它们之间有一个狭窄的间隔，你必须站在这个间隔里才能避免遭受这两种攻击。其中一个攻击为悲泣之女的箭矢倾泻，另一个则为纳里莫尔国王的流星攻击。

* **冰元素** :  必须专注于这些小怪。它们有巨大而沉重的攻击，并在地面上施放令人难受的震慑和定身的高伤害范围技能。当这些技能施放出来时，停止攻击BOSS，尽快击杀它们。

* **小型冰震区** :  这与召唤傀儡的震区基本相同，只是略大一些，请注意脚下。这些通常会在间歇泉生成之前发生。

* **守卫们** :  这些小怪必须以任何代价作为优先目标击败，坦克必须时刻将它们嘲讽。它们有很高的生命值，可怕的范围攻击，还有重击能够一击击败任何坦克，即使是肉墙般的坦克也需要进行格挡。DPS和治疗师不能阻挡它们的重击。如果其中一个攻击了你，请确保时机准确，躲避攻击，否则就会一命呜呼！

这些怪物会在首领的血量百分比时刻生成，因此你必须小心不要过度攻击，除非你真的可以应对！

他们在生命值达到75%、55%和35%时会生成。





### 黑暗法球

> Dark Orb


**黑暗之球**

这个BOSS可能会让有些玩家变成狗屎，特别是那些想卖弄自己的DPS的人。这里有很多要考虑的事情。4个机制必须被理解，还有一个主要目标和很多小怪！你的坦克不仅要强壮，而且要能够在多个目标上保持仇恨并让它们远离团队。如果小怪开始四处奔波，所有人都会死！主要的焦点当然是暗黑球，但在战斗期间，当生命值降到一定百分比时，暗黑球会引入新的机制，你必须集中精力才能在杀死主要目标之前解决它们。所以，团队合作在这里非常关键。

* **基本增援单位** :  在战斗过程中会不断产生不同类型的基本增援单位，包括近战型、弓箭手和魔法师，它们的生命值较低。坦克应尽快将它们聚集在一起，由团队消灭。它们不是真正的威胁，但与即将出现的<strong>BIG adds</strong>相结合，可能会有些难以承受，因此一定要消灭它们，并中断箭矢倾泻等能力！

* **黎明卫士** :  这些小兵将在战斗中不断生成，共有四种不同类型。

每个都有不同的效果，但都是致命的！它们可以释放黎明破晓者（Dawn Breakers），不同的元素效果，还有一些令人讨厌的前置区域效果的闪电绝地（Jedi）力量类型的能力。坦克必须抓住它们并且始终保持面向团队的方向。

四种不同的类型如下:

1. Quests任务

Quests are missions given to players by various NPCs throughout the game. They often involve traveling to different locations, defeating enemies, and completing tasks to earn rewards and progress the story.

任务由游戏中的各种NPC向玩家提供。它们通常涉及前往不同的位置，打败敌人，完成任务以获取奖励并推动故事进展。

2. Dungeons地下城

Dungeons are instanced areas that players can explore with a group of up to four other players. They typically involve fighting through waves of enemies and defeating a boss at the end for loot and experience.

地下城是实例化的区域，玩家可以与最多四名其他玩家一起探索。它们通常涉及击败一系列敌人并在结尾打败一位首领以获取战利品和经验。

3. PvP Player versus Player 玩家对战

PvP allows players to battle against each other in different modes, such as team deathmatch or capture the flag. It takes place in specific battlegrounds or in the open world of Cyrodiil.

PvP允许玩家在不同的模式中进行对战，例如团队死亡竞赛或抢旗。它发生在特定的战场上或在塞义尔的开放世界中。

4. Trials试练

Trials are the most challenging PvE content in the game. They are designed for groups of 12 players and involve fighting through multiple waves of enemies and bosses. They offer the best rewards in the game in terms of gear and achievements.

试练是游戏中最具挑战性的PvE内容。它们专门为12名玩家设计，涉及打败多个敌人和首领。它们提供了游戏中最好的装备和成就奖励。

* **Radiant Auroran（耀眼的欧洛拉）是一种技能也被称为耶稣光束它在游戏中代表了光明神 Auri** : El 的能量。它可以释放出强大的能量光束，对敌人造成巨大伤害。

翻译如下：磷光欧洛伦（冰）

炽热的欧洛兰人（火）

闪耀欧洛
(Auroran是游戏中的一种精灵)

这些中的每一个都可能带来与它们相对应类型的球体类似的效果。

这款游戏叫Elder Scrolls Online，《悲泣之女》是一种鬼魂，莎莱雅是一位角色，雯、恩和莫尔也是角色，纳里莫尔国王是一个国王角色，箭矢倾泻是一种技能，“纳里”可能是一个地名，獠牙巢穴是一个地点，流星也是一种技能。

* **球体** :  在战斗期间，黑暗球体会在房间里产生其他的球体和小兵！

这是需要将你的注意力从主要目标转移到房间中的宝珠的时候。有4种类型的宝珠：

* **辐光（黄色）** :  这些能影响团队的治疗效果。

* **磷光（蓝色）** :  它们会造成范围寒冰伤害并在地面上留下寒冰陷阱，必须避开。但是它们会在中心生成一个冰柱，只需使用轻攻击即可击败。治疗师需要集中治疗那些接近它们的人，因为它们造成大量的范围伤害。

* **炽火（红色）** :  这个技能会在每个玩家头顶释放流星，当每个流星落地后会迅速在地面散开成多个移动的区域攻击。你必须先躲避流星的落点，然后迅速进入散布开的攻击区域的缝隙中躲避。这个技能非常棘手，必须迅速学会解决它（尤其是对于最后一个boss来说非常重要）。

* **闪耀的（紫色）** :  这些会造成闪电伤害，并且可以从每个玩家身上投掷多个快速的飞溅物，落在地面上。快速地在一个紧密的圆圈里移动可以让你避免伤害并让它们分散，但如果你不这样做，你会承受更多伤害并迅速死亡！

战术！：集中攻击黑暗球，当小怪出现时，让坦克把他们全都拉到角落里，用AOE和终极技能集中攻击它们。

当出现魔法球时，先击杀魔法球，然后击杀剩余的小怪，再返回中心区域的主魔法球。当下一个魔法球出现时，先击杀魔法球，然后击杀小怪和黑暗魔法球，反复执行此步骤。





### 纳里莫尔国王

> King Narilmor


**纳里莫尔国王**

这个boss会让队伍很吃亏！这里需要用到一个全新的机制。起初，你们会在房间中间与BOSS战斗，坦克需要将BOSS背向团队并简单地集中火力，同时在需要时打断BOSS的技能。但是接下来情况就会变得疯狂了。BOSS会分裂成x4！坦克需要嘲讽所有BOSS，并通过射程来调整它们的位置，使它们尽可能靠近彼此，同时维持嘲讽并帮助打断它们的技能。这会变得非常棘手！

* **分裂** :  这个BOSS会分裂成4个镜像，每个镜像都有攻击力，而其中只有一个是真正的BOSS。有很多方法可以应对这种情况，但我们在视频中展示的是我认为最容易的方法之一（除了“作弊”，我们不会这样做！）。

每次首领分裂时，让两个DPS集中攻击一个目标。如果伤害护盾消失并且该目标消失了，那么它是一个假的目标，继续攻击下一个。重复此过程。

然而，如果伤害护盾消失了，它继续受到伤害......留在那个BOSS身边！那才是真正的BOSS！

此时坦克需要保持嘲讽和打断技能，同时尽量将它们放置在彼此靠近的位置，以避免围着房间跑。

提示：每个反射boss都可以拥有与主boss相同的能力。要注意很多打断技能！有时每个boss不到5秒就会打断你两次。这就是你最基础的“教程教授的机制”发挥作用的时候了。要节制你的资源，并尽可能多地利用“砸打”或物理打断目标的能力。如果不这样做，你将会被消灭。

懒惰的玩家会引起频繁的团灭，所以要专注于机制。

* **在元素的面前不要退缩** :  首领和每个反射体都可以拥有随机的颜色（蓝色/红色/黄色/紫色），如果你之前没有注意上一场战斗，那么这将毫无意义。

简单来说，每种颜色代表前一场战斗中的“ORB技能”。

* **黄色区域** :  会对小组造成生命偷取效果的debuff，并且可以施放必须被打断的耶稣光束（Radiant Oppression）。

* **蓝色技能** :  对范围内目标造成冰系伤害，并产生冰霜波及范围伤害（不要站在这个范围内），并在地面上留下冰霜陷阱，务必避开，但它们会在中心位置产生一个冰柱，可以用轻攻击击败它们。

* **红色** :  这些会向每个玩家召唤流星，落地后它们会爆炸成多个基于地面的移动伤害区域。你必须避开流星，然后进入散布的伤害区域之间的空隙。

紫色：它们会造成闪电伤害并在地面上释放多个快速的溅射效果，每个玩家都会释放出溅射效果。快速地绕成一个紧密的圆圈可以让你避免受到伤害并让它们消散，但如果你不这样做，你将被伤害淹没并很快死亡！

* **圣光之力** :  这和圣骑士的技能基本相同。它会施放给一名玩家，并且随着时间的推移，它会吸收更多的伤害，然后爆炸。如果你看到首领或任何反射物正在引导，请确保打断它。

* **黎明破晓** :  老板/反射会偶尔施展黎明破晓剑的砸击动画，对站在它正面的人造成巨大伤害。在此发生时不要站在boss前面，如果你是坦克，请确保进行格挡。

* **莎莱雅和奎恩特** :  在战斗中，奎恩特和莎莱雅正在战斗！请为莎莱雅保持治疗（我们在视频中使用基本的范围治疗），以防她陷入麻烦。如果鬼魂在她面前占了上风，boss们将会获得巨大的伤害护盾，战斗将会变得更加艰难。要小心！治疗师在这里需要做很多工作，保持团队和NPC的生存非常重要！许多持续性治疗和基于地面的AOE治疗是保证每个人生存的关键！





### 利刃交响曲

> Symphony of Blades


攻略翻译如下：

** 刀锋交响曲 **

这个BOSS的战斗很简单，如果你理解了该地下城副本中其他部分的颜色机制。然而，最重要的是，这场战斗完全建立在协调和步伐上。没有什么赶紧的事情，也没有DPS要求。这场战斗真的就是全靠机制！

坦克应该把BOSS拖至房间中央，团队成员应该站在BOSS后方，以三角形的形式排列。永远不要放弃对BOSS的嘲讽！

* **重击** :  这是一种非常简单和明显的机制，首领将发动一次很大的重击，这必须被格挡。如果由于某种原因你不是坦克，而重击攻击正朝向你，就要恰当地计算时间，进行闪避（DODGE ROLL）。不要逃跑，也不要试图格挡，否则你就会死亡。

* **范围伤害和眩晕** :  这是一个非常简单的机制。小组中的一个玩家将被随机选择，并且会在他们的脚下生成一个扩散的范围伤害，并与他们相连。不要惊慌，也不要逃跑，这是针对你的。所以简单地格挡，当它爆炸时，从中脱离。尽可能保持静止，不要将其放在队友的头上。如果有其他人身上有这种效果，请不要跑进范围伤害内。让它自然结束。

* **旋转** :  这非常类似于Hel Ra的第一头目，那个头目会疯狂旋转剑并显示旋转范围的AOE。在此之前，你会收到一个AOE正在扩散的简短警告。一旦它达到高峰，就会开始攻击。任何被卷入此攻击的人都会死亡，除非他们是坦克。一些坦克可以站稳并挡住攻击，其他人可能想向后走并持续挡住攻击，将头目慢慢引导到攻击结束。但是不管怎样，你一定不要穿过团队带着攻击。DPS和治疗人员应该远离攻击。

* **投掷剑** :  首领会施展一项技能，看起来像是抱住自己。这个技能可以被打断，但如果没有打断，首领会将他的剑以旋转方式抛出，在前方旋转一圈后再返回。这会造成中等程度的伤害，并不算对坦克构成太大威胁，但DPS和治疗应该避免。如果你的坦克有经验，对于Hel Ra的第一位首领，所有这些机制都将非常熟悉且几乎相同。

* **长城** :  不要惊慌！是的，你在獠牙巢穴中见过幽灵墙，但它的伤害方式与此不同……基本上，如果你触碰到它就会死亡。但与獠牙巢穴不同的是，你可以杀死这些幽灵！每个阶段都会有两堵墙，一面在前面，一面在后面。只要让你的团队专注于一个幽灵并杀死它，然后进入新的间隙以保持安全并让墙通过。大多数情况下，最简单的选择是同意攻击中间的目标。这样，坦克基本上不必移动，你可以像平常一样继续。

* **黎明守卫** :  在首领的生命值百分比阶段和墙壁阶段，首领会变成免疫状态！

当这种情况发生时，将会有4个步行的黎明天使从房间的每个角落出现。红色、紫色、黄色和蓝色每个代表前几个Boss的伤害类型和效果。

你需要在目标选择的苍穹骑士到达中心前将其击杀。每一个到达首领处的苍穹骑士都会融化并加强他的对应效果40秒！

如果他吞噬了一个黄色的小怪，他将能够给小队施加一种治疗减益和对坦克施加一种“耶稣光束”。

如果他使用红色，他会释放流星。

如果他吃蓝色的东西，他会产生冰的范围攻击和冰柱，并造成范围冰属性伤害。

如果他吃了紫色的东西，就会生成可怕的闪电溅射。

这些专有名词在其他首领中都有详细的解释，但你必须充分了解每个名词的作用，才能对抗它。

如果他被增强了，这并不是世界末日，因为这是基于时间的，如果你理解机制，你可以避免它们，但是你杀死的Aurorans越多，他就会被减弱，变得更容易。然而，如果你只能杀死一个，我们发现红色的流星增益是最危险的，所以把注意力集中在红色的上面。如果失败了，闪电（紫色的）也可能成为一个问题。所以优先选定一个目标并坚持下去。

* **在大约80左右会发生这个阶段然后再在大约50** : 45%左右发生（取决于重叠机制）。

* **宝珠** :  在战斗中，“黑暗宝珠”首领生成的宝珠会以随机颜色出现在房间里！此时你需要将注意力从首领身上转移，尽快击落宝珠。宝珠始终是优先打击的目标！除非有城墙出现，那么优先攻击城墙，其次是宝珠，最后才是首领！

和以前一样，有四种类型的球体：

* **黄色** :  这些会对小组造成治疗减益。

* **蓝色** :  这会造成范围冰属性伤害，并在地面上产生冰元素区域，必须避开，但它们会在其中心生成一个冰柱，并可以仅用一次轻攻击就击败。由于它们会发出大量范围伤害，治疗师需要将治疗重点放在靠近这些区域的任何人身上。

* **红区** :  这些会向每个玩家发射流星，当它们落地时，会爆炸成多个基于地面移动的区域伤害。你必须避开流星，然后再找到中间散落的区域去躲避。这是非常棘手的，必须快速学会如何应对。

* **紫色** :  这些会造成闪电伤害，每个玩家会投射出多个快速喷溅的光点。快速移动并保持紧密的圆形路径可以避免伤害并让它们消散，但如果不这样做，你会受到过多的伤害并很快死去！

* **最终战斗** :  当BOSS的血量下降到11%以及以下（根据重叠的机制不同），BOSS将进入天界，并拉着你一起下去。他的最大生命值翻倍，血量回升至50%...所以基本上你需要通过超过700万的生命值才能通过。其中，The Weeping Woman、Ghost、Tharayya、Ven、En、Mor、King Narilmor、Ri、Arrow Spray、Ghost、The Weeping Woman、Nari、Fang Lair和Meteor等为游戏中的专有名词。

这比人们想象的简单得多。它不是简单的烧杀，没有执行机制或惊慌失措。您可以花尽需要的时间，但有规则！

坦克必须在任何时候都把Boss的仇恨抓住，并让Boss背对着小队。

当你第一次进入其他领域时，首领很忙于进行远程攻击，实际上他不会移动，所以如果你想利用这个机会，你可以有一点爆发。如果失败了，就为球体积攒你的终极技能吧！是的，它们即将到来。

这个BOSS现在拥有了全部四种元素类型的攻击！

闪耀 = 5秒治疗削弱和对坦克使用耶稣光束(技能)

闪电飞溅 = 在远离人群的地方绕圈引开你的飞溅。

流星 = 避开撞击并避开它们中心的冲击波（基本上离开）。

冰霜区域 = 击杀支柱并避免站在范围效果中。

这些都很容易应对，只需要分开站位，绝对不要堆在一起。如果你堆在一起，你会死。

当所有这些事情发生时，它们的房间中会出现带有随机颜色的球体，这必须是你百分之百的注意力所在！消灭球体！ Boss不会在任何地方消失，无论代价如何，必须将球体消灭！你可以花费任意长的时间来袭击Boss，但是这些球体必须走！

最后（这场战斗最棘手的机制）墙回来了……它们是更小的墙，所以你可以绕过它们而不是杀死幽灵，但你将会有大量幽灵从许多不同的方向涌来。 

注：除专有名词外，其他词汇没有进行翻译，已保留原文。

如果你一直靠着角落或者边缘待在那里，你就会有很大的风险，使得它们在你站的地方刷新出来，所以不要贴着边缘待着！

当围墙缩小时，注意球体并消灭它们，留意机制并躲避它们，同时对BOSS造成伤害，保持散开状态并绕着围墙走动。

这需要集中注意力和零惊慌。如果你惊慌，你就会死。

再次重申，不需要着急。 慢慢来，避开墙壁，并继续做你正在做的事情，直到那个首领被击败。

堆叠，无视燃烧，恐慌会让你全军覆没！

注意力集中！祝你好运！

> This can be simple or a complete mess! This will take some co-ordination and above all as LITTLE panic as possible. Sounds easy right? Well actually to most based on this boss's design that is the complete opposite of what ends up happening in PUGS. This boss to the inexperienced player can come across terrifying, so if you don't like horror films, leave that at the door! The tank will need to focus, be very careful of positioning, do NOT drop taunt, and above all collectively, stay together as a group during the mechanics. Scooby Doo is usually right, splitting up to look for the bad guys is a BAD idea (you will see why)!
> 
> **Breath** - As expected of Hunger type enemies, this boss does have a  nasty frontal cone shaped breath attack. This does high damage over time and needs to be avoided. If you are dps or healers and you stand in this you WILL die. The tank must try to keep the boss faced away from the group and block this while staying alive. If you run around the breath will follow you and you will end up spinning this onto the group and they will wipe. You MUST maintain a taunt and keep it off the group. If the boss goes loose for any reason and you as a dps/healer are in it, the best option you have for survival is to dodge roll through the boss to spin it BACK onto the tank so they can recover. But generally if this mechanic is not controlled, you are dead.
> 
> **Spit** - The boss fire a nasty poison spit at the tank (or whoever has agro). When this lands, anyone standing in it will take HUGE damage over time. Most tanks will not be able to stand up to this.
> 
> Not to mention the boss will actually fire this twice! So when it lands, step backwards out of it with the boss (maintaining a taunt) and when the second one lands do the same (walk backwards). Once you are out of BOTH of the aoes you will be safe. The dps and healers should follow the tank's path BUT do NOT stand in stupid, you will die!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will Launch a heavy attack and if this is on the tank a simple block will suffice. If you miss you are going to be knocked down and most likely will die.
> 
> **Shadow Jump** - The boss will vanish into the air and a heavy attack mechanic (white sparks) will be aimed at the group, presented by a spreading aoe under the feet of the players. When the aoe hits is peak and he is about to HIT, dodge roll out of it and your sill survive. If you don't you will be killed!
> 
> **Hide and seek!** - This is the mechanic that makes everyone panic. You are in a scary warehouse type room with an invisible hunger stalking you!
> 
> This will happen based on health and at each stage you will have to complete this phase the same way.
> 
> This will happen at 80%, 50% and finally at 25%!
> 
> The boss will disappear and you will need to find him, BUT aoes will spawn out of the ground, which you MUST avoid (represented by a spreading aoe and then a totem will appear). Adds will spawn (as many as 3 hungers) which need to be killed and if you FIND the boss...whoever found him will be fed on and pinned to the ground.
> 
> THIS is the most important thing to note...make your TANK lead the group and everyone must STAY TOGETHER! If you split up the one left alone and they accidentally trigger the boss they will be fed on and die in the dark!
> 
> When someone finds the boss you must interrupt the boss to get them off of your team mate and then continue the fight with the above mechanics.
> 
> Key points: Stay together, kill adds, avoid aoes, interrupt the boss when he jumps out and pins whoever finds him. If you stick to this, you will be fine. If not it is your own horror story!
> 
> 
> 
> The Weeping Woman
> 
> 
> ** THE WEEPING WOMAN **
> 
> This fight is actually pretty straight forward but can get messy extremely fast if people don't pay attention or get too cocky. If you try to NUKE this boss and you don't have good aoe damage, you will get overwhelmed with adds and these adds are NO picnic. These can heavy attack a dps and one shot them, they can even one shot a tank! SO, pay attention to the mechanics, watch your feet and try not to show off too much. Most pugs wipe and rage quit because of these problems.
> 
> **Geyser** - This is a typical Nerid/leminid type mechanic which if you have seen Scaelcaller you should be familiar with. Multiple geysers will spray out of the ground. If you get hit by these you will be suspended in the air and take HUGE damage. Watch your feet and don't stand in these!
> 
> **ICE!!!** - This is extremely easy to see. You will get 2 types of AOE attacks in the room which look like big whirling ice effects. These must be avoided following the description of each type below and at low health you will get BOTH!Outside AOE: This is a big ring around the outside of the room which you need to avoid by staying in the middle of the room.
> 
> Inside AOE: This is the same as the above but instead of being on the outside of the room, is in the middle! Simply do the opposite of the above and stay on the outside.
> 
> Execute AOE: During low health you will get BOTH of these aoes and there will be a thin strip between the two which you must stand in to avoid them both.
> 
> **Ice Atronach** - These adds must be focused. They have huge heavy attacks and put nasty stunning and immobilizing high damage based aoes on the ground. When these are up stop focusing the boss and kill them as soon as possible.
> 
> **Small Ice Aoes** - These are pretty much the same as the aoes the Atronachs can place just a bit larger, watch your feet. These usually happen before the Geysers spawn.
> 
> **Watchers!** - These adds MUST die as a priority target at ALL costs and the tank must have these taunted at ALL times. They have high health, they have nasty aoe attacks and above all their heavy attack can one shot even the meatiest tank if they are not blocking. DPS and healers CANNOT block their heavy attack. If one of these is swinging at you, be sure to time it well and dodge roll other wise it is goodnight!
> 
> These will spawn at health % of the boss and this is why you have to be careful not to over burn unless you can really handle it!
> 
> They spawn at 75%, 55% and 35% health.
> 
> 
> 
> Dark Orb
> 
> 
> ** DARK ORB **
> 
> This boss can be a bit of a pug killer especially with people that like to yolo and show off about their dps. There are a lot of things going on here. 4 mechanics that have to be understood as well as a main target and SO many adds! Your tank has to be not only strong, but capable of holding agro on MULTIPLE targets and keeping them OFF the group. If adds start running around the room, everyone is dead! The main focus is of course the Dark Orb, but during the fight at health % the dark orb will introduce new mechanics which together you must focus before killing the main target. So, team work is KEY here.
> 
> **Basic adds** - During the fight several different basic adds will spawn, melee types, archer types and mages and these are fairly low health. The tank should pull these together as soon as possible and they should be killed by the group. These are not a real threat but on top of the BIG adds that are coming, can get a little overwhelming, so be sure to kill these, and interrupt arrow spray type abilities!
> 
> **Aurorans** - These adds will spawn through out the fight and there are 4 different types.
> 
> Each one has different effects but all are deadly! The can cast dawn breakers, different elemental effects and also some nasty frontal aoe lightning jedi power type abilities. The tank MUST grab these and keep them faced away from the group at all times.
> 
> The 4 different types are :
> 
> Radiant Auroran (Jesus beam)
> 
> Phosphorescent Auroran (ice)
> 
> Blazing Auroran (fire)
> 
> Scintillating Auroran (lightning)
> 
> Each one of these can have similar effects to the orbs of their corresponding types.
> 
> 
> 
> **ORBS!** - During the fight the Dark orb will spawn OTHER orbs in the room as well as the adds!
> 
> This is when you need to take your focus off the main target and focus the orb in the room. There are 4 types of orbs:
> 
> **Radiant (yellow)** - These can affect the group with healing debuffs
> 
> **Phosphorescent (blue)** - These cause aoe ice damage and place ice aoes on the ground which MUST be avoided however they do spawn an ice pillar in the middle of them and they can be killed with JUST a light attack. The healer will need to focus heals to anyone close to these due to the amount of aoe damage they emit.
> 
> **Blazing (red)** - These call down meteors to each player and when they land they burst into multiple floor based moving aoes. You must avoid the meteor and THEN get in the gaps between the scattered aoes after wards. These are tricky and must be learnt to be dealt with FAST (incredibly important for the last boss).
> 
> **Scintillating (purple)** - These cause lightning damage and can cast multiple fast paced splashes on the ground coming from EACH player. Moving in a fast tight circle will make you avoid the damage and let them disburse but if you do not, you will get overwhelmed with damage and die fast!
> 
> TACTICS!: Focus the Dark orb, when the adds spawn get the tank to pull them all into the corner and focus them with aoe and ultimates.
> 
> While orbs are present, KILL the orb and THEN kill remaining adds before going back to the main orb in the middle. When the next orb spawns, go kill the orb, THEN the adds, then the dark orb, rinse repeat!

> This boss is another pug killer! This is where a completely new mechanic comes into play. You start off fighting the boss in the middle of the room with the tank turning the boss away and simply focus on what you are doing while interrupting mechanics as and when, BUT things are about to get crazy. The boss will split into x4!! The tank needs to taunt ALL bosses and manipulate their positioning with range to get them as close to each other as possible while MAINTAINING taunts and helping to interrupt them. This is gona get tricky!
> 
> **The Split!** - The boss splits into x4 reflections each with a damage and only ONE of them is the real one. There are many ways to do this but in the video we demonstrated what i would consider one of the easiest methods (apart from 'cheesing' which we will NOT be doing!).
> 
> Each time the boss splits up, get the 2 dps to focus on ONE target. If the damage shield falls off and that target disappears, if is a fake one and move on to the next. Rinse and repeat.
> 
> HOWEVER, if the damage shield falls off and it continues to take damage...STAY on THAT BOSS! it is the REAL one!
> 
> The tank at this point needs to keep taunts, and interrupts while trying to carefully position them as close to each other as possible to prevent lots of running around the room.
> 
> NOTE: every boss reflection can have the SAME abilities as the main boss. There are a LOT of interrupts to pay attention to! Sometimes 2x per boss in less than 5 seconds. This is where your most BASIC 'tutorial taught mechanics' come into play. Pace your resources and be sure to utilize the 'bash' move, or abilities that physically interrupt targets as MUCH as possible. If you do not, you WILL wipe.
> 
> Lazy players here will cause constant wipes. So focus on the mechanics.
> 
> **Against the elements!** - The boss and every reflection can have a RANDOM color (blue/red/yellow/purple) and yes unfortunately if you didn't pay attention to the previous fight this will make NO sense.
> 
> Simply put however, each colour represents the ORB abilities from the Previous fight.
> 
> Yellow - Affects the group with (life steal) healing debuffs and can cast Jesus beam (Radiant Oppression) which can and MUST be interrupted.
> 
> Blue - AOE Ice damage as well as a spreading ice blast (don't stand in this) and place ice aoes on the ground which MUST be avoided however they do spawn an ice pillar in the middle of them and they can be killed with JUST a light attack.
> 
> Red - These call down meteors to each player and when they land they burst into multiple floor based moving aoes. You must avoid the meteor and THEN get in the gaps between the scattered aoes.
> 
> Purple - These cause lightning damage splashes and can cast multiple fast paced splashes on the ground coming from EACH player. Moving in a fast tight circle will make you avoid the damage and let them disburse but if you do not, you will get overwhelmed with damage and die fast!
> 
> **Power Of The Light** - This is pretty much the same as the Templar ability. This will be cast onto one player and over time it will absorb more damage before it explodes. Be sure to interrupt if you see the boss or any reflections channeling.
> 
> **Dawn Breaker!** - The boss/reflections will occasionally cast a dawn breaker sword slamming animation and will do HUGE damage to people in front of it. Do not stand infront of the bosses when this happens and if you are the tank, be sure to block.
> 
> **Tharayya and Quintus!** - During the fight Quintus and Tharayya are fighting! Keep heals on Tharayya (we did in the video with basic aoe heals on the ground) to stop her from getting into trouble. If the Ghost gets the better of her, the bosses will get MASSIVE damage shields and the fight will get a LOT tougher. Be careful! The healer has a lot to do here keeping the group up and the NPC, BUT many hots and many aoe ground based aoe heals is key to everyone's survival!

> 
> This boss is a simple fight IF you understand the colours mechanics from the rest of the dungeon. However above all this fight is 100% built on co-ordination and footwork. There is NO rush and there is NO dps requirement. This fight really is ALL about mechanics!
> 
> The tank should hold the boss in the center of the room and the gorup should stand in a triangle formation BEHIND the boss. Never drop the taunt on that boss!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is a very simple and obvious mechanic, the boss will hit with a large wound up heavy attack and this MUST be blocked. If for some reason you are not the tank and the heavy attack is coming to you, time it well and DODGE roll it. Do not run away do NOT try to block, you WILL die.
> 
> **Aoe and Stun** - This is a very simple mechanic. One player in the group will be picked at random and a spreading aoe will spawn under their feet and be connected to them. Do NOT panic, do NOT run, this is on YOU. So simply block while it pops and when it does, break from from it.  Stay as still as possible and do not put it on top of your team mates. If someone else has this on them do NOT run into the aoe. Let it run it's course.
> 
> **SPIN!** - This is very very similar to the first boss in Hel Ra, where the boss spins his swords like crazy and has an AOE showing the distance in which the spin will reach. Prior to this you get a brief warning of the aoe spreading. Once it hits its peak it will start. Anyone caught in this spin will die unless they are a tank. Some tanks can stand still and block it, others may want to walk back wards holding block to slowly kite the boss until it is over. BUT at all costs you must NOT run through the group with this. DPS and Healers should just stay out of the spin.
> 
> **Sword Throwing** - The boss will channel an ability where he will look like he is hugging himself. This can be interrupted but if NOT he will throw his swords spinning out in front of him and then they will return again. This deals moderate damage and is not too much of a threat to the tank but should be avoided by the dps and healers. If your tank is experienced in the first boss of Hel Ra, so far all of these mechanics are going to be extremely familiar and borderline identical.
> 
> **THE WALL!!!** - Do NOT panic! Yes you have seen the ghost wall in fang lair and this is no different in the way that it works damage wise...Basically if you touch it, you die. BUT unlike fang lair you can KILL the ghosts! Wach phase there will be two walls. One in front and one behind. Simply get your group to focus on ONE ghost and kill it, then get in the new gap to be safe and let the wall pass. The easiest option most of the time is to agree on the middle target. That way the tank really doesn't ever have to move and you can continue as normal.
> 
> **Aurorans!** - During Health % stages of the boss, as well as the wall phase, the boss will go IMMUNE!
> 
> When this happens there will be 4x sow walking Aurorans coming from each corner of the room. Red, purple, yellow, blue and each one represents the damage types and effects from previous bosses.
> 
> You need to kill the Aurorans of YOUR choice before they reach the middle. Each one that REACHES the boss will dissolve and buff him with THAT effect for 40seconds!!!
> 
> If he consumes a yellow add he will be able to apply a heal debuff to the group and a Jesus beam to the tank
> 
> If he consumes red he will apply meteors
> 
> If he consumes blue he will spawn ice aoes and pillars and aoe ice damage
> 
> If he consumes Purple he will spawn nasty lightning splashes.
> 
> All of these were explained in detail in other bosses but you must understand what each one does fully to fight against it.
> 
> It is not the end of the world if he gets buffed because it is time based and if you understand the mechanics you can avoid them, BUT the more of the Aurorans you kill, the less he will be buffed and the easier it will be. However if you can only kill one, we found the red meteor buff to be the most dangerous, so focus the red one. Failing that, the lighting (purple one ) can also be an issue. So prioritize a target and stick to it.
> 
> This stage will happen around 80% and again at around 50-45% (depending on overlapping mechanics).
> 
> **ORBS!** - During the fight the orbs from the 'Dark Orb' boss will appear in the room with a random colour! This is when you need to take your focus off boss and get the orb down as fast as possible. Orb ALWAYS takes priority!! UNLESS there is a wall coming in which case, wall first, orb second, boss last!
> 
> EXACTLY like before there are 4 types of orbs:
> 
> Yellow - These can affect the group with a healing debuffs
> 
> Blue - These cause aoe ice damage and place ice aoes on the ground which MUST be avoided however they do spawn an ice pillar in the middle of them and they can be killed with JUST a light attack. The healer will need to focus heals to anyone close to these due to the amount of aoe damage they emit.
> 
> Red - These call down meteors to each player and when they land they burst into multiple floor based moving aoes. You must avoid the meteor and THEN get in the gaps between the scattered aoes after wards. These are tricky and must be learnt to be dealt with FAST.
> 
> Purple - These cause lightning damage and can cast multiple fast paced splashes on the ground coming from EACH player. Moving in a fast tight circle will make you avoid the damage and let them disburse but if you do not, you will get overwhelmed with damage and die fast!
> 
> **THE FINAL FIGHT!!!** - At 11% health and below (depending on overlapping mechanics the boss will go into the Celestial Realm and drag you down with him. His MAX health doubles and his health goes up to 50%...so basically yes, you have over 7million health to get through.
> 
> THIS is a lot simpler than people think. It isnt a burn fest, there is no execute mechanic or panic. You can take as long as you need to BUT there are rules!
> 
> The tank needs to taunt the boss at all times of course and keep the boss faced away from the group.
> 
> When you first spawn into the other realm the boss is so busy putting down long ranged attacks that he in fact wont move, so you DO have a bit of a burst moment here if you want to take advantage of it. FAILING that, save up your ultimates for the ORBS! Yes they are coming.
> 
> The boss now has ALL 4 element type attacks!
> 
> Radiant = 5 second heal debuff and jesus beam on the tank
> 
> Lightning splashes = Tight circles away from people to kite your splashes away from you.
> 
> Meteors = avoid the impact and then avoid the splash from the center of them (basically get away)
> 
> Ice = kill the pillar and don't stand in the aoe
> 
> These above all are EASIEST managed by simply spreading out and NEVER stacking. If you stack you WILL die.
> 
> WHILE all of this is happening Orbs will enter the room with a random colour and these must be your 100% focus! Kill the orbs! The boss isn't going anywhere, get them down at all costs. You can take as long as you need passively killing the boss but those orbs have got to go!
> 
> And finally (the trickiest mechanic in this fight) the walls are back...they are smaller walls, so you can run AROUND them rather than killing the ghosts, but you are going to get  LOADS of them coming from many different directions.
> 
> If you hang on the edges too much or in a corner you run a massive risk of them spawning where you are standing so do NOT hug the edges!
> 
> When the walls come in, keep an eye on the orbs and kill them, keep an eye on the mechanics avoid them, keep damage on the boss, STAY spread out AND walk around the walls.
> 
> This takes a lot of focus and ZERO panic. If you panic you will die.
> 
> Again to repeat, there is NO rush. Take your time, avoid the walls and keep doing what you are doing until that boss is dead.
> 
> Stacking, over burning without looking, and panic will kill you all!
> 
> Focus! And GOOD LUCK!
