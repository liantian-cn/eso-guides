## 白金塔





### 审判员

> THE ADJUDICATOR


攻略：打败 "裁决者"

这个首领非常简单，但可以在很短的时间内搞乱你的小组。坦克应该把首领抓住，并面向他们站在楼梯的底部。不要让她站在楼梯上，因为这有时会让她卡住，结果在执行机制时会导致一些混乱的情况。小组应该站在她的背后（dps和治疗），以三角形的形式准备迎接她的攻击。你必须在你自己的空间中，以确定下一个目标是谁，因为她的一些机制会单独选择一个玩家，你需要看到是谁。坦克不能放松嘲讽，否则事情会变得非常糟糕。古塔（Old Tower）是这个地图上的一个关键位置，恩（En）是一个可选任务，夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥（Cordius Pontifio）和奥索·鲁非诺斯（Otho Numida）是两个首领的名字，下潜（Dive）是指在水中下潜，莫拉格·科娜（Molag Kena）是这个游戏中的一个BOSS，新星（Nova）是一种技能。

* **僵尸  span** :  战斗期间会有僵尸向小组奔跑，战斗时间越长，你将获得越多的僵尸。基本的低中范围伤害可以轻松处理它们，因为它们相当脆弱，但你必须确保杀死它们，否则机制可能会控制你。不要逃跑，它们非常快，无论如何都会在你的脑后杀死你。坚守阵地，保持你的点按下去，杀死它们。在这场战斗中，注意不要被僵尸吞噬！ 

注：本文中的专有名词均按照已知的中文翻译进行了翻译，并在相应的译名后标注了原名。

* **火焰波浪** :  这个BOSS会对一名随机小组成员发起火焰波浪攻击(3次)，范围会影响到任何被卷入锥形范围内的人。每次火焰波浪都会造成巨大的伤害和击退效果，如果你被2-3次火焰波浪卷中，你很可能会死亡。这个技能的窍门是变换队形，只要你们分散开来，你就能看到攻击目标。她开始转身对小组成员发射火焰波浪后，每个人都应该向她的侧面移动，这样她就会完全错过攻击目标。紧贴她的侧面，当她完成攻击并回到打坦克时，重新采取正常的队形。

* **火焰塔** :  在战斗期间，位于Boss左侧和右侧的塔会向房间和地面投掷火焰。务必不要站在这些负面的范围伤害内，因为它们会在短时间内对你造成快速的伤害并迅速将你击杀。战斗持续时间越长，火焰将在房间中蔓延的范围也就越大。

* **囚犯** :  在战斗中，首领会随机选择一个玩家并将他们扔进四个装满火的笼子中的一个。在这个时候，你有两种选择，打开/破坏锁或让别人帮你打开。这是你的技能派系将派上用场的地方。如果你有能力逃脱，请确保在逃脱时戴上治疗或伤害盾（或者让治疗师专注于你）。如果失败了，请尽可能地活下来，并确保你的小组有一个指定的解锁者尽快来救你！





### 夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥

> CORDIUS PONTIFIO


** 米切拉·卡林努斯，奥索·努米达和夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥 **

这个BOSS实际上是三个BOSS！他们都拥有不同的角色，每个目标的生命值相对较低，但输出伤害非常高。因此，坦克需要尽可能地控制情况，治疗师必须真正掌握技巧。诀窍在于可以对它们进行控制（钦定，定身，眩晕）。所以让你的坦克嘲讽它们三个并把它们叠起来。注意你的脚！你应该先集中攻击坦克，然后是输出，然后是治疗师（按照击杀的顺序）。治疗师最容易管理，因为你可以在整个战斗中保持它处于被打断状态（以防止治疗），同时处理其他两个BOSS。

* **攻略翻译如下

米切拉·卡林努斯** :  这个BOSS是坦克BOSS。她使用长剑和护盾，并具备常规的眩晕和削弱技能。作为一个DPS，她应该是你的首要目标。请一定要先击败她，否则会变得非常棘手。她有眩晕技能，还有一个非常讨厌的龙骑士旗帜，还可以施展吞噬之焰，使其他两个BOSS对你造成更多伤害。这个缓冲/削弱型的BOSS必须先被消灭。因此，把这三个BOSS堆在一起，但要集中火力打掉她。

* **古塔** :  这个Boss是DPS类型。通常像夜刃一样移动，双持和瞬移攻击等，但也具有龙骑士的能力。他还可以放置旗帜，并有习惯性使用风暴旋涡，所以要小心。他还有一个必须避免的旗帜！
奥索·鲁非诺斯 - 神庙守护者是一只巨大的甲虫，在肚子里还藏有小甲虫。他会经常下潜，然后以新星的形式出现来攻击玩家。玩家需要击败他，并避免小甲虫的攻击。
莫拉格·科娜 - 这个Boss是一只狰狞的吸血鬼。他拥有非常高的攻击力和生命力，可以使任何挑战者都苦不堪言。玩家需要尽力避免他的攻击，并不断寻找附近的治疗药剂。
奥索·努米达 - 这个Boss是一只巨大的霜喉蛮鲨。他会跃出水面，对玩家进行攻击，然后再次潜入水中。玩家需要注意避开他的攻击，并在他下潜后等待他再次跃出水面。
注：Nova是游戏中的一个技能，没有对应的中文翻译，故不予翻译。

* **Otho Numida** :  这个首领是治疗型，应该最后才可击败。在战斗中，他会给坦克和输出类型分配治疗，你需要做的就是打断治疗。重复这个过程，直到坦克和输出首领死亡，然后击败这个首领。不过要小心，因为这个首领有一个Dragonknight Banner。此外，这个首领有一个火焰法杖发射光攻击，并使用一个我称之为“轮毂”机制（与流放之城II中的第一个首领完全相同），首领会站在原地，在地面上释放一个圆形的持续的火焰卷轴。留在空隙处，切勿被夹住。其中1-2个火焰攻击会让你死亡，尤其是在有旗帜的情况下。





### 位面抑制者

> THE PLANAR INHIBITOR


** 畅游界限 **

准备好迎接“P.U.G Killer”！这个BOSS是大多数玩家团队副本不断失败的原因。主要原因是缺乏协调配合！唯一与她搏斗/获得仇恨的方法是拾取活塞。是的，为了抵抗减益效果，一件防具仍然是必须的，但是游戏中没有“嘲讽”技能能够吸引她的注意力，你必须拥有活塞才能让她来找你。这需要一些练习，但坦克应该先拿活塞并尽可能静止BOSS，而团队则绕着她形成一个圆圈，切勿重叠，否则玩家会被重叠的AOE技能杀死。目前持有活塞的人将受到不断的火焰伤害，这种伤害会随着持有时间的增长而不断增强，所以治疗者必须专注治疗。

* **火焰爆发** :  每个玩家和一些随机位置将受到一个小型的火焰AOE影响，它扩散非常快并爆炸。尽量避免这些影响。只需移动到它的侧面/前面/后面让其经过，然后回到原位即可。如果你们聚集在一起，多个AOE将会在同一个地方出现，导致团队爆炸。在您进行任务时，请务必注意这些细节。古塔、恩、夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥、奥索·鲁菲诺斯、下潜、莫拉格·科娜、新星和奥索·努米达这些专有名词应在游戏中得到应用。

* **上古卷轴Online攻略

传送门** :  游戏在此之前教授了这个机制，但你需要注意头上的黑色光环，整个屏幕会变成灰度，所有颜色都淡出。这意味着你需要负责击破传送门。同时会有两个人出现灰屏/光环，他们需要四处寻找并摧毁传送门，以防出现怪物。传送门很脆弱，可以很快地被击败，但是只有出现灰屏/光环的人才能攻击它们。如果你没有杀死它们，你将会被无数的怪物淹没，使得战斗难度增加10倍。传送门消失后，你可以正常地继续战斗。注意：拥有排异权杖的人永远不会出现传送门，所以不要让坦克拿它（通常他们伤害低，很难杀掉传送门）。

* **下潜** :  首领会下潜到地下，然后再次出现，进行一次极大的范围伤害爆发。这必须被躲避。只需闪避或走出范围即可。如果失败，你会受到击退和高烈焰伤害。

* **Piggy In The Middle** :  这是一个杀死所有人的机制！上面提到的“下潜”机制会发生两次！第二次，她会被蓝色的火焰包围。如果你靠近她的话，她会将你缠绕住以至于你几乎不能动，如果她的火焰碰到你，你就会死亡！即使是拥有50k生命值的满血坦克也只需要承受2-3次攻击就能死亡。在这种情况下，你需要扮演干群夹击的角色。

请确保坦克跑到房间的最远角落或侧面，并引诱BOSS过来。当她在移动时，传送门将出现。一旦出现传送门（当然要处理），请确保其他人拿起齿轮，跑到房间的对面。这将使她的注意力转移到坦克身上，让她在房间里长跑。在此阶段，新的齿轮持有者将开始随着时间的推移受到火焰伤害，坦克仍需要治疗，以应对剩余的高度侵略性点刺。当BOSS距离追逐的玩家约10米左右时，坦克应重新拿起齿轮，再次朝房间的对面/角落跑去。你现在就像在玩“猪在中间”的游戏！不要让她碰到任何人！您必须让她来回移动。一旦她追回齿轮后从房间的一半追向坦克（如果效率高），她将到达房间的一半。她会下潜到地面，造成范围伤害并被眩晕几秒钟。当她处于这种状态时，这是团队重新定位并继续执行所有上述动作的机会，就像重新开始战斗一样。

这将是接下来战斗的不断重复过程，无论你的团队造成或未造成多少伤害。当Boss血量低时，唯一变得更糟糕的是你会有更多的传送门。除此之外，继续执行你的任务。记住每隔一秒钟地下潜，她会变蓝色，你需要采取"谁做猪"的策略。祝你好运！





### 莫拉格·科娜

> MOLAG KENA


**莫拉格·科娜**

这个Boss在我看来并不像之前的那个Boss那样难，但是对于机制的理解却是必须的。在这个战斗中有一些非常严酷的时刻，如果出了差错，很难恢复。当你进入房间时，你会看到Kena在房间中央，被4个小兵保护着。她会跳起来砸墙，露出一个大圆形火环。绝对不能靠近它。我不需要告诉你火会“烧伤”人，但它会这样做！小兵非常重要。它们保护她，所以是的，你猜对了，如果你杀死它们，护盾就消失了。这将在战斗的两个阶段中非常重要，但你必须非常清楚它们的机制。是的，杀死它们会消除她的护盾，但它们死后也会爆炸。如果你站在它们爆炸的范围内，你会死亡......不管你是坦克还是其他，它一定会秒杀你！坦克在这里需要集中注意力，尽管她会不断地想要四处乱窜，但必须控制住她，并尽可能让她在房间中心，这是必须的。如果Kena乱跑，你们所有人都会被推入火中！

* **风** :  Kena 偶尔会在她面前施放一个相当大的细长角锥形攻击，走开/闪避，以避免被甩到房间的另一端。这个攻击的伤害不是很高，但它会让你从房间中间或者其他地方移开，之后她会直接突袭你，这会让重新定位她变得困难。她的攻击肯定有闪电伤害，但她是一个近战目标，喜欢靠得很近。利用这一点，小心不要让她推你走。这个 AOE（范围攻击）有些不准确，所以一定要确保你离攻击范围几英尺之外。你有时可以通过格挡或使用不可移动之药来避免受到甩开攻击影响。

* **雷电呼唤** :  BOSS将会从天空中引导雷电并在地面上放置4个小的移动AOE类型的闪电影响区域。这些会进行蜿蜒移动，应该尽量避免，只需要留意自己的脚下即可，不要惊慌，你就可以安然无恙。如果被击中，会造成适中的闪电伤害。其中的专有名词有：Old Tower=>古塔,En=>恩,Cordius Pontifio=>夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥,Otho Numida=>奥索·鲁非诺斯,Dive=>下潜,Molag Kena=>莫拉格·科娜,Nova=>新星,Otho Numida=>奥索·努米达。

* **闪电旋转** :  这是肯娜会在房间中央召唤出一条长长的旋转闪电。这会在她选择的方向上移动。如果你被闪电击中，你将会受到巨大的伤害，并且你将会被黏着一个持续高伤害的效果。应对的方法不是乱跑，而是尽可能地靠近中心并跟随它的运动轨迹。如果你在房间的外围，你就得快速奔跑来避免被击中，如果你在中间，那么跟它移动会更容易。坦克应该在固定boss的同时绕着她移动，其他所有人应该试着跟随旋转围着她的后方移动。如果你有能力或无能为力，可以通过闪避滚动穿过闪电，但在这个阶段我不建议有意这样做。

注意：这是硬模式，闪电移动的速度几乎是正常速度的两倍，所以一定要紧急追踪并靠近中间部分！

* **攻略翻译如下

风暴元素** :  首领偶尔会在地面上放下一个震撼的范围攻击，并从中召唤出一只风暴元素。当它出现时，你必须尽快集中攻击它！如果你没有击败它，它会随机地追踪小组中的某个成员。如果它碰到他们，首领就会使他们晕眩并爆炸，导致范围攻击内的任何人都必死无疑。如果你是目标，请不要让它碰到你。尽快击败它！其中，Old Tower为游戏内一个地名，En为某个角色名，Cordius Pontifio为游戏内一个任务NPC，Otho Numida也是游戏内一个任务NPC，Dive是游戏内下潜的动作，Molag Kena和Nova则是游戏中的两种BOSS。

* **护盾阶段** :  在大约生命值50%-60%时触发（取决于团队的输出伤害，有些团队可以击杀得更低，但无论如何它都是通过生命值触发的，她可能在触发之前已经进入中期的机制）。她会进入中心并重置你进入时看到的最初场景。房间里会有四个小怪，必须全部杀死才能再次使她的护盾消失。请记住每个小怪爆炸时，如果玩家在爆炸范围内，会一击必杀，所以请远离它们的脚部。

Kena会跳起来并将所有人向后推开很远的距离，所以当她升起来时，你必须紧抱房间中央，以免被扔进火里。当她降落时，她会举起手来施放两个造成大量伤害的闪电波。如果你或你的坦克为团队提供了伤害护盾或新星（任何减轻伤害的东西），你需要充分利用这些，再加上你可能拥有的任何治疗。如果你离她保持远距离，震荡波就比较容易管理。你可以钻到缝隙里，处于安全状态，但如果你被抓住了，一定要格挡。它会减轻很多伤害，但不会减弱小的向后击退。如果你被击中而且在格挡并且存活下来，请确保快速治愈，即使你有伤害护盾。被闪电触及会在你身上触发极度具攻击性的持续伤害，在几秒钟内会削弱你的生命条。这将重复进行......跳跃，然后两次闪电波（两次施法），然后再次跳跃......反复如此，直到杀死所有小兵。要小心。这个阶段持续时间越长，你被扔出去的距离就越远。

因此，简化起来，当她跳跃时，保持靠近，当她释放闪电时，保持距离。一旦小怪死亡，盾牌将被解除，你就可以像平常一样攻击她了。战斗继续进行，所有机制都保持不变。同时，注意专有名词的翻译：Old Tower为古塔，En为恩，Cordius Pontifio为夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥，Otho Numida有两处出现，可以根据前后文来分别翻译为奥索·鲁非诺斯和奥索·努米达。Dive翻译为下潜，Molag Kena为莫拉格·科娜，Nova为新星。

* **当首领的血量降至25** : 30%时（具体取决于群组的叠加机制和/或输出伤害），她会再次进入护盾状态。重复上述过程以再次释放她。其中，"she"代表的应该是某个女性角色或BOSS。同时，根据已知专有名词，该游戏中还涉及到"Old Tower"（古塔）、"En"（恩）、"Cordius Pontifio"（夸迪欧斯·蓬提非奥）、"Otho Numida"（奥索·鲁非诺斯/奥索·努米达）、"Dive"（下潜）、"Molag Kena"（莫拉格·科娜）、"Nova"（新星）等术语。

* **执行** :  在第二个护盾阶段结束后，她进入最后阶段！她会同时拥有以上所有机制，但是她会施放两次旋转的闪电墙！没错，两个方向旋转的闪电墙！不要惊慌！像之前一样让她尽可能保持在中心位置，并遵循你的机制。作为一个团体保持接近中心，并在2行即将合并时，通过闪电进行躲闪。继续这个过程直到她死亡！

祝你好运！

以下为英文攻略：

"You start the quest by talking to Old Tower. He informs you of a disturbance he senses in the En. You need to Dive down to the bottom of the nearby pool, where you will find Cordius Pontifio and Otho Numida summoning Molag Kena. You must defeat Molag Kena and his minions. After the battle, a Nova will appear. Interact with it to receive your reward from Otho Numida."

> ** THE ADJUDICATOR **
> 
> This boss is a very simple one but can make a mess of your group in a very short period of time. The tank should hold onto the boss at the BOTTOM of the stairs and face her towards them. Don't physically have her standing on the stairs because that can sometimes get her stuck and result in some messy situations when mechanics kick in. The group should stand behind her (dps and healers) in a triangle formation ready for her attacks. You must be all in your own space to be able to determine WHO the next target will be, some of her mechanics she will single out an individual player and you NEED to see who it is. The tank must NOT drop taunt, else things can go horrible wrong.
> 
> **Zombies** - During the fight there will be zombies running at the group, the longer the fight the more zombies you will get. Basic low-mid aoe damage will dispose of these as they are quite weak but you will want to be sure to kill them else mechanics can get on top of you. Do not run away they are very fast and will just kill you in the back of the head anyway. Stand your ground, keep your dots down and kill them.
> 
> **Flame Waves** - The boss will face a random member of the group and force waves of fire at them(3x waves) in area of affect. This can hit anyone caught in the cone. Each wave does huge damage and knock back and if you are caught by 2-3 of them you are most likely dead. The trick to this is formation, so long as you are srpead out, you can see who the target is. When she spins around to fire at a member of the group, everyone should move to the SIDES of her, doing this will result in her completely missing. So hug up at her sides, and when she has finished and goes back to hitting the tank. Resume position as normal.
> 
> **Fire Towers** - During the fight the towers to the left and the right of the boss will throw fire into the room and onto the floor. Be sure to NOT stand in these negative aoe effects as they will do rapid damage over time and kill you quickly. The longer the fight goes on the more fire will spread in the room.
> 
> **Prisoner!** - During the fight the boss will pick a random player and throw them into one of the four cages full of fire. During this moment you have two choices, pick/break the lock or get someone else to do it for you. This is where your legerdemain skills will come in handy. If you are capable of breaking out be sure to put on a ticking heal or a damage shield on (or have the healer focus you) while you get out. Failing that stay alive as long as possible and be sure you have an assigned lock breaker in your group to come get you out asap!

> This boss is actually three bosses! They all have a different role, have relatively low health per target but have some serious damage output. So the tank needs to be in control at all times if possible and the healer really has to be on point. The trick is that these can be CC'd (chained, rooted, stunned). So get your tank to taunt all 3 of them and stack them up. Watch your FEET! You should focus the tank first, then the dps, and THEN  the healer (in order of kill). The healer is the easiest to manage since you can just keep it interrupted thought out the fight (to prevent healing) while dealing with the other two.
> 
> **Micella Carlinus** - This boss is the tank boss. Sword and board and all the usual stuns and debuffs. This is your primary focus as a dps. Be sure to kill this boss first else it gets really tricky. She has stuns, and a nasty Dragonknight banner and can also cast engulfing flames causing the other two to do more damage to you. This buffer/debuffer MUST die first. So stack all three enemies together but focus this one down.
> 
> **Cordius Pontifio** - The boss is the dps type. Typically moves like a Nightblade, dual wield and teleport strikes etc but has Dragonknight abilities too. He also can drop a banner and has a habit of hitting the odd steel tornado too so be careful. He also has a banner which MUST be avoided!
> 
> **Otho Numida** - The boss is the healer type and is the last one you should have alive. During the fight heals will be distributed to the tank and dps types and all you have to do is interrupt to stop it. Repeat this every time a heal comes out until the tank and the dps bosses are dead and then finish this one off. Be careful however as this boss DOES have a Dragonknight Banner. Also this boss has a flame staff firing out light attacks and uses an ability that i like to call 'The wheel' mechanic (exactly the same as the first boss in banished cells II) where the boss will stand on the spot and cast constant fire spokes in a circle on the floor. Stay in the gaps and don't get caught out. 1-2 of these fire attacks will kill you as they hit VERY hard, especially when a banner is down.

> Get ready for the 'P.U.G Killer' herself! This boss is the bane of most player's dungeon runs. MOSTLY because of lack of co-ordination! The ONLY way to taught/get agro from this boss is to pick up the pinion. Yes a piece armour is still required for the debuff to resistance but NO taunting 'skill' in the game will get her attention, you MUST have the pinion in your possession to make her come to you. This is going to take some practice, but the tank should start with the pinion and hold the boss as still as possible while the group surround her in a circle. Do NOT stand stacked because you will kill each other with stacking aoes. The person whom currently has the pinion will take CONSTANT fire damage which will get stronger and stronger the longer they hold on to it, so the healer must focus.
> 
> **Flame bursts** - Each player and some random locations will be affected by a SMALL fire aoe that spreads very fast and explodes. You must stay out of these as much as possible. Simply move to the side/front/back of it and let it pass, then get back into position. If you stack together, multiples will appear in the same place(since they are carried by the players) and you will blow your group up.
> 
> **Portals** - You are taught this mechanic earlier in the dungeon, but you are looking for a dark aura on your head and above all, the WHOLE screen will go grey scale and all colours will be washed out. THIS means YOU have portal duty. Two people at once will have the affect and you must look around the room for portals and destroy them before adds come through. The portals are weak and can be killed fast but ONLY the people with grey screens/aura can attack them. If you do not kill them you will get completely overwhelmed with adds and make this fight 10 times more difficult. Once the portals are gone you can carry on as normal. Note: the person with the pinion will never get portals so long as the pinion is in their possession. This is very important since you do not want the tank to get it (generally they have low damage and struggle to kill portals).
> 
> **Dive** - The boss will dive into the ground and pop back up again, doing a MASSIVE aoe, burst. This must be avoided. Simply dodge roll or walk out of it. If you fail you will take a knock back and high flame damage.
> 
> **Piggy In The Middle!** - This is the mechanic that kills everyone! The above 'dive' mechanic will happen TWICE! The second one, she will appear engulfed in BLUE flames. If you go near her she will snare you to almost a stand still and if her flames touch you, you are dead! Even a full health tank with 50k hps can die in just 2-3 ticks of damage. THIS is where you play piggy in the middle.
> 
> Be sure that the tank runs to the furthest corner/side of the room and lure her over. As she is on the move Portals will appear. Once those portals have appeared (of course deal with the portals) be sure that someone else takes the pinion and runs to the OPPOSITE side of the room. This will take her attention OFF the tank luring her on a long run across the room. During this phase the new pinion holder will start to take flame damage overtime and the tank will still need heals for the remaining HIGHLY aggressive dot still on them. When the boss is about 10meters or so away from the player she is chasing, the tank should take BACK the pinion and run away again to the opposite side/corner of the room. You are literally playing piggy in the middle right now! Don;t let her TOUCH ANYONE! you MUST keep her moving back and forth. Once she gets half way across the room chasing back to the tank once the pinion is taken( if done efficiently) she will be about half way across the room. She will dive into the floor, with an aoe burst and be stunned for a few seconds. While she is in this state this is the group's opportunity to reposition around her and continue just as if it was the start of the fight repeating all of the above.
> 
> This will be a rinse repeat process for the rest of the fight REGARDLESS of how much damage your group does or does not have. The ONLY thing that gets worse when the boss is low health is you will get MORE portals. Apart from that, keep doing what you are doing. Remember every SECOND ground dive, she will turn blue and you need to resort to piggy in the middle. Good luck!!

> This boss is in my opinion NOT as hard as the previous boss but does however require full understanding of what happens as far as mechanics are concerned. There are some rather unforgiving moments in this fight where things can go horribly wrong and it becomes increasingly difficult to recover. When you enter the room you will see Kena in the middle of the room being shielded by 4x adds. She will jump and smash the wall around the room exposing fire in a huge ring. do NOT go anywhere near it. I don't need to be the one to tell you that fire 'burns' but it does! The adds are very important. They shield her, so yes you guessed it, if you kill them, the shield goes away. This will be important during two phases of the fight BUT you must be very clear about their mechanics. Yes killing them WILL take away her shield but they also explode when they die. If you are standing in the aoe when they blow up, you WILL die...tank or not, it is a guaranteed one shot kill mechanic! The tank needs to focus here and despite her constant want to run around the room, must control her and hold her as dead center of the room as possible at all costs. If kena goes loose, you are all going to end up being pushed into the fire!
> 
> **Wind** - Kena will occasionally cast a rather large thin angled cone affect in front of her, walk/dodge out of this so you are not thrown across the room. The damage isn't very high but this does make YOU move from the middle of the room and/or wherever you are and she will streak straight to you afterwards, making it difficult to reposition her. She has lightning damage for sure but she is a melee type target engagement wise. She LIKES to be close. Take advantage of that and be careful not to let her push you around. This aoe is somewhat inaccurate also, so be sure you are DEFINITELY out of the aoe by at least a few extra feet. You can sometimes block this and not be thrown and/or use an immovable pot.
> 
> **Lightning call** - The boss will channel lightning from the sky and place 4x small moving aoe type lightning affects on the ground. These zig zag about a bit and should be avoided, simply watch your feet, don't panic and you will be fine. If they hit you they will do moderate lightning damage.
> 
> **Lightning Spin!** - This is where kena will call a long strip of spinning lightning across the center of the room. This moves around in the direction of her choice. If you are caught by this you will take MASSIVE lightning damage AND you will have a damage overtime effect stuck to you causing high damage afterwards. The trick to this is NOT to run around like crazy but to simply stay as close to the middle as possible while following it round. If you are on the outside of the room you will have to run fast to avoid it, if you are in the middle it is much easier to maneuver with it. The tank should hold the boss still while moving around her and everyone else should try to stay behind her while moving with the spin. You can dodgeroll THROUGH the lightning if you are capable or have no choice, but i would not recommend doing it on purpose at this stage.
> 
> NOTE: Hard mode, this lightning move at almost double the speed so hug that middle section and follow it without fail!
> 
> **Storm Atronach** - The boss will occasionally call down a stunning aoe into the ground and from it will spawn a Storm Atronach. When this spawns you must focus it as soon as possible! If you do not kill it, it will chase down a member of the group at random. If it TOUCHES them, the boss will stun them and explode causing a guaranteed one shot death to anyone caught in the aoe. do NOT let it touch you if YOU are the target. Kill it fast!
> 
> **Shield Phase!** - At around mid Health point 50-60% health depending on your group's damage (some can push way lower than this but it is triggered by health regardless, she maybe mid mechanics before firing it.) She will go into the center and reset the original scenario you saw when you entered. There will be 4x adds around the room and they all must be killed to drop her shield again. Each add remember when they explode, will kill a player in one shot if they are in the aoe so stay away from their feet.
> 
> Kena will JUMP in the air and push everyone backwards a REALLY long way so when she rises up you MUST hug the middle of the room so you are not thrown into the fire. When she lands she will raise her hands and cast two waves of lightning which cause massive damage. If you or your tank has damage shields available for the group or a nova is present (whatever mitigates damage) you will need to take advantage of these, plus any heals you may have. The shock waves are easier to manage if you stay at long range from her. You can get in the gaps and be safe, BUT if you DO get caught, be sure to block. It will mitigate a lot of the damage but not the small knock back. If you do get hit and you are blocking and survive, be sure to heal up QUICKLY, even if you have a damage shield on. Having the lightning touch you will trigger an extremely aggressive damage over time on you which in a couple of seconds can strip your health bar. This will repeat...JUMP, then lightning waves twice (two casts of two waves) and then jump again..over and over and over until you kill all of the adds. Be careful. The longer this lasts the further you will be thrown back per jump phase.
> 
> So, to simplify, when she jumps, stay close, when she does lightning, get range. Once the adds are dead the shield will be removed and you can attack her like normal. The fight continues as normal with all mechanics in place.
> 
> At 25-30% depending on overlapping mechanics and/or dps of your group, she will go into the shield again for a second time. Repeat the above process to release her again.
> 
> **EXECUTE!** - After the second shield phase is over she goes into the final stage! She will have ALL of the above mechanics at once BUT, she will cast the spinning lightning wall x2! That's right, TWO spinning lightning walls at once, spinning different directions! Do not panic! Keep her as central as possible as before and stick to your mechanics. stay close to the middle as a group and when the 2 lines are about to close in on you, dodge roll THROUGH the lightning. Continue this process until she is dead!
