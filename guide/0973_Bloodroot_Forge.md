### 玛斯加梅因

> Mathgamain


** 玛斯加梅因 **

这个Boss的机制非常简单，但如果操作不当会非常惩罚性。坦克需要始终保持嘲讽。整个战斗中，坦克需要将Boss的身体朝向远离小队的方向！

* **重击** :  Boss直立起来，向承担仇恨的目标发起一个巨大的攻击范围锥形AOE重击。这个时候应该由坦克承受伤害并格挡此攻击。否则，坦克会在一击中即死，攻击威力非常强大！

如果出现奇怪的情况，BOSS瞄准了DPS或治疗成员进行重击，那么他们必须适时进行闪避，否则他们将被击杀。DPS/治疗成员无法用格挡来抵挡这一攻击，攻击太强了，只有坦克可以减少伤害。

* **小怪** :  在战斗期间，将会生成一波波的小怪，必须处理掉。坦克可以使敌人定身并嘲讽，以控制它们，但同时必须对Boss保持嘲讽并不将Boss对准小队。这些小怪会在Boss的特定血量百分比时生成（75％、50％和25％），因此对Boss进行超量伤害会导致小怪重叠，并可能会被多个小怪淹没。这些小怪也会进行重击，因此小队必须小心如果它们被注视（可以格挡）。

如果你被大量小怪包围，请不要开始逃跑！这样做是没有帮助的，让坦克去尝试控制它们。逃跑不会让你失去任何正在追逐你的敌人，它们会一直追你直到死亡。不要惊慌！

这很容易理解。只要进入护盾内，用攻击堆叠技能迅速攻击Boss即可。





### 凯拉奥菲

> Caillaoife


** 凯拉奥菲 **

这个Boss可能会比较棘手，需要坦克有良好的协调和快速思考！坦克应尽可能地让Boss集火并面对他/她，同时使用嘲讽（在战斗中她会免疫嘲讽）。这场战斗相当灵活，所以人们不要恐慌，不要像无头苍蝇一样开始逃跑。这场战斗的诀窍是控制增援并集中火力！

* **攻略翻译如下 

禁地** :  在战斗中，首领会变得免疫并围绕她建起一道树木的力场。一旦看到她施法使这个力场建起来，你必须立即离开该区域，以避免接触盾牌时收到的击退和击倒机制。立刻离开！当她被屏障保护时，她免疫所有伤害和嘲讽，并会选择攻击玩家（下面会更详细解释）。一旦该阶段结束，她将传送到新位置，你可以再次攻击她。这个机制要在整场战斗中反复执行。

注：这个阶段会在75％，50％和30％时出现。

* **小兵** :  在保护罩阶段，小兵会出现，坦克必须尽可能快地抓住它们并将它们转向远离团队的方向！这时，所有的输出应该集中攻击小兵而不是BOSS（BOSS对所有伤害和嘲讽免疫）。最重要的是要集中攻击熊小兵。如果这个小兵用重击攻击一个DPS/治疗职业，即使他们格挡也会一击致命。坦克必须格挡攻击，其他人必须远离攻击范围。这只熊和前面的BOSS几乎一样，只是血量少得多。一旦小兵被打败，回到BOSS身边，或者等待她离开树木保护罩并传送到新位置。

* **冬季之握** :  在你与小怪战斗期间的护盾阶段，嘲讽技能将会从BOSS身上抽出。然后她会随机选择一个玩家（通常是一个DPS）释放地面上带有寒冷属性的高伤害AOE。该AOE会使人无法移动。如果对坦克命中，则无法限制其移动。但是对于DPS和治疗者来说，可能会导致他们一击死亡。在BOSS聚焦于其所选目标时，她也会向该目标发射轻型攻击。治疗师必须专注于其治疗并在BOSS瞄准该目标时迅速离开AOE范围。尽量找到一个没有人站的地方，留心观察你的位置。靠近其他玩家会导致多个玩家同时遭受攻击，从而导致团灭。

* **爆炸** :  在战斗期间，首领将朝着仇恨目标的方向施放一个巨大的锥形范围技能。这是一道岩石/尼恩晶体的爆炸性伤害，并且会对任何被击中的人造成不小的伤害，并将其击退/击倒。坦克可以格挡它，但其他人必须使用闪避来躲避它。

* **攻略

扼颈者** :  在护盾阶段，击杀小兵的同时，将会出现扼颈者，必须迅速清理，否则你将会在房间里制造大量毒素，你的小队将承受巨大伤害（在视频中解释了Boss之前的情况）。





### 石心

> Stoneheart


**石 心**

这个首领在战斗中其实相当灵活，需要频繁移动。坦克需要一直让首领被嘲讽。小组成员在战斗中需要非常注意地面上的区域伤害，因为有许多会让人感到不便的地面aoe伤害。

* **火圈** :  在战斗中，每当Boss传送到新位置时，它会对拥有仇恨的目标（应该是坦克）进行三次轻攻击，每次轻攻击都会在地面上留下一个火圈，应该避开！如果你只在火圈中停留了短暂的一瞬间，它不一定会秒杀你，但是如果你在其中停留超过一秒，伤害将非常高，因此尽量不要触碰这些火圈。火圈会在短时间内消失。

* **侍灵** :  在每次完整的机制旋转后，首领会将他的手升入空中，许多红色的飞行物体会从他的法杖射向房间中一个随机的石质侍灵。然后他会传送到一个随机位置。这些侍灵必须尽快集中火力消灭。如果你杀死它们的速度不够快，它们会变得愤怒，并在每秒钟在每个玩家下放置可怕的nirncrux圆圈，一遍又一遍地对任何被捕捉到的人造成高伤害，直到它死亡为止。如果你不停地移动，这些圆圈可以被放置在地上和/或由玩家引导（就像Domihaus机制一样），但当然它们最终会追上你并杀死你。因此，消灭侍灵是击败这个机制，防止你的团队被灭团的关键。

* **太空侵略者** :  我能够描述这种机制的最好方式是“太空侵略者!”。 基本上，首领会蹲下来，大量的非常小的、快速移动的区域效果会在地面上飞来飞去，一遍又一遍地瞄准团队成员，直到他完成这个效果的引导为止。 基本上这就是老派太空侵略者训练的时候了，您基本上只需在它们之间摆动身体，避免被击中。 左右移动以避免它们会很好。请不要在房间里狂奔，因为当然会重叠到许多危险区域，并造成伤害。放松，晃动下身体，然后继续。 如果这些区域效果碰到您，它们每次会造成多达30-40％的生命值损失，所以要小心！

* **能力** : 根须** - 当boss生命值低于25％时，他会开始用藤条定住玩家的脚，使他们无法移动。如果你在整个过程中待在此机制内，一旦它结束，它将会爆发并对你造成高伤害。战胜此机制的方法只是在看到效果时闪避翻滚以摆脱它。因此，特别是对于魔法用户，不要在房间里到处奔跑，你需要保留资源来避免此机制。





### 盖尔卓巴尔

> Galchobhar


**盖尔卓巴尔**

这个BOSS是秋田犬杀手，也是大多数玩家的噩梦！战斗区域很小，而且有很多重要的机制需要掌握，全部都在一个战斗中！坦克在任何情况下都不能放弃控制这个BOSS。当然，坦克在任何情况下都不应该放弃BOSS，这是不好的习惯......但是这个BOSS会让团队灭的非常快！

* **重击爆发** :  首领将使用他的巨型武器进行重击，与地下城中其他牛头人相同的机制。一旦重击落地，地面上会留下一个小型区域效果，并且类似火山喷发的机制会迅速从其位置喷发出来。坦克必须站在这个区域上并持续格挡来堵住漏洞。

* **挥动** :  BOSS（通常在重击之后）会对拥有仇恨值的人进行前方范围攻击，并会释放3个小的火焰范围攻击。简单地躲避这些攻击即可，它们的大小与太空入侵者（译注：游戏中的一个怪物类型）的范围攻击相同，造成的伤害也差不多。

* **攻略翻译如下

肖克斯** :  如果你已经来到这一步，你应该已经理解了这个机制，但我还是会解释一下。整个战斗中肖克斯将会出现并需要被聚焦。这些肖克斯会以负面aoe的形式瞄准一个个体，并追逐他们直到追上并撞击它们，然后爆炸并造成可怕的火焰持续伤害（请注意，即使有很大的治疗，大多数人都无法生存下来）。如果你是肖克斯的目标，你的屏幕上会出现一条信息，并且屏幕边缘会有火焰。这时你必须逃跑并跳到熔岩上的一个平台上。一旦跟随你的aoe在熔岩中消失，你就可以跳下来重新加入战斗。你必须摆脱这种效果，不要试图坦住它，你会死的。在整个战斗中，你会有5个这样的效果，具体取决于你杀死boss的速度。

* **侍灵** :  当首领血量降至50%时，他会唤醒房间里的石质侍灵，一个每个阶段。这些侍灵与前一个首领战斗中的侍灵完全相同（如上所述），必须尽快击败。如果未能这样做，它们会在每个玩家的脚下施放范围技能，您将不得不持续移动以避免受到伤害，同时将它们放在地面上，使您非常难以立足而不死亡。这些侍灵必须尽快击败，无论付出什么代价。

* **大爆炸** :  首领会将武器猛力插入地面，形成一个巨大的范围伤害并快速蔓延到整个平台！这时每个成员都必须迅速逃离并跳上周围的平台/岩石。等范围伤害爆炸并火焰消失后，你可以跳下来重新回到房间，但需要注意以下几点。

当范围攻击消失但火焰仍然存在时，请不要跳进去，火焰会秒杀你。

此外，这些垫子/石头/平台...它们只能承受一定数量的时间压力（玩家站在上面）。如果一个人使用它，随着时间的推移，它会爆裂和消失，但是如果多个玩家站在上面，它的压力将会更大，并且它们很快就会消失！每个人只能使用一个垫子，否则就会#阵亡！

如果你没有走到岛屿上就会死亡，如果你回到岛屿时（火仍然存在）太早，你也会死亡，如果你贪心想要多个人站在一个岛上，那么你必然会在熔岩中死去。集中注意力，进行协调！





### 格里戈·牛血

> Gherig Bullblood


** 格里戈·牛血 **

这个BOSS实际上是三个BOSS，必须加以控制。坦克应该始终对它们使用嘲讽技能！牛人会站在他喜欢的地方，非常固执，因此最好面对面嘲讽并将其固定。近战BOSS会当被嘲讽时会向坦克跑过来，因为他是近战单位，因此也可以很容易地堆叠在牛人身上，但治疗/远程BOSS只有在你们离她太远同时有仇恨时才会过来（这是关于嘲讽技能的基础知识，基本上离开他们的范围，他们会移动到你身上直到能够攻击）。这样想，用嘲讽技能吸引住牛人和近战单位，同时嘲讽远程BOSS。向后跑以吸引远程BOSS，然后带着两个近战单位跑回到远程BOSS的位置，以形成良好的堆叠。视频中演示了这一点。

* **锁链** :  牛头人(Minotaur)和你们之前在地牢中遇到的一些牛头人有相同的机制，但是注意到非常关键。首领会用锁链固定2名小队成员，然后在他们脚下出现扩散性的aoe效果。必须打断首领才能打破锁链，被固定的人（现在自由了）必须离开aoe。锁链可能被释放，但aoe仍会爆炸。一旦启动打断，如果没有打断或者没从危险中脱离出来，那结果就是一次极其危险的一击！

* **重击** :  牛头人和近战首领都可以进行重击。坦克必须格挡这些攻击，否则他/她将被击退/倒地，并很可能被击杀！

* **爆发** :  近战boss将以自己为中心对团队施放一个巨大的扩散AOE技能。这必须被回避。如果你没有在它爆炸之前脱离它的范围，你将承受巨大的伤害，如果它没有杀死你，还会被眩晕。这意味着你必须摆脱这个眩晕。如果以上所有这些机制交叉重叠，并且在这个眩晕AOE技能命中的同时未能打断某个目标，那将是一场灾难！注意！

* **治疗** :  远程BOSS（法师）能治疗其他两个BOSS和她自己。一旦发现应立即中断。

* **元素攻击** :  法师有很多持续时间短的通道技能，可以通过直接伤害和范围伤害的形式对小组造成伤害，具体取决于她当时执行的技能。这些技能可以被打断。如果被控制住，她可能是三个boss中最容易的一个，但是她必须被打断。只要你每次看到她施法都打断她...治疗和伤害对她来说几乎是不可能的。所以如果你注意力集中，这是一个非常简单的boss。

首先，必须尽快击败这三个敌人，堆叠攻击是最安全的选择。将这三个敌人堆叠在一起，不要松开嘲讽，并且不惜一切代价中断敌人释放的机制。首先集火牛头人，以摆脱锁链机制，然后击败近战BOSS，因为这样您只需要面对重击和AOE攻击，最后击败法师。不要坐在房间中央附近，因为熔岩池会从中心处蔓延，并杀死你（如果你被三次熔岩击中，就会被眩晕/控制）。





### 地血混合体

> Earthgore Amalgam


** 地心融合亚马尔 **

这个首领比看起来简单得多，但由于所有夸张的效果，它可能变得有些混乱。坦克绝不能在任何情况下丢掉嘲讽。你有一个首领，但最终会有三个目标。你的坦克必须有能力管理资源，并始终保持对多达三个目标的仇恨！基本上，如果你能够在以太神殿中坦住斧头（多达3个），你就可以胜任这个首领。如果不能，就多练习。这里没有容错的余地。定位、协调对于小组至关重要，但最重要的是坦克必须注意。

* **重击** :  这非常简单。Boss会发出一个非常强的重击。如果坦克在格挡，他们会存活下来，如果没有，他们就会死亡。如果这个攻击击中了一个DPS/治疗玩家，而他们正在格挡，那么他们仍然会死亡。这是一次非常强的打击，你需要坦克所提供的减伤来抵挡。所以，如果出现了一些可怕的错误，导致坦克无法控制Boss，而你作为DPS或治疗者有仇恨，你唯一的机会是闪避……不要逃走或四处乱跑，因为他仍然会追上你，你仍然会死亡，而且有人必须来救你，因为你搞砸了事情。在正确的时候进行闪避，让坦克恢复控制。

* **熔岩尼恩克鲁克斯池** :  这可能是战斗中最重要的机制。Boss会用手向他选择的方向进行聚能，并散发出一道火焰/尼恩克鲁克斯的轨迹在地面上形成一池熔岩/尼恩克鲁克斯。它可能很近，也可能很远，但无论发生什么，千万不要碰它，也不要靠近它！如果你靠近它，你每秒钟会受到从中喷射出来的弹道的伤害。连续三次命中会使你化石，并在仍然受到伤害的情况下被眩晕并死亡！大多数人都会在这之前死亡，所以简单地远离这东西！

这个机制可能会出现在任何地方，所以要保持警惕。有时你可能会很幸运地看到岩浆在房间外边溅射，但也可能会很近。在这个机制下，坦克需要控制BOSS。如果岩浆离你很远，就继续把BOSS拉在原地。如果岩浆离你很近，一定要重新调整BOSS的位置，并团队一起移动。

* **岩石** :  在战斗期间，岩石会从天花板上掉落，一定要避开它们，否则如果你不是坦克，它们会造成高伤害。

* **下雨啦** :  在战斗的某些阶段，首领会变成免疫状态并且会引发天上掉下大石头的攻击。每位玩家都会被瞄准掉落大石头，必须在它们落地前躲开。这相当容易避免，但是请尝试找到自己的空间，不要像一只无头苍鸡一样四处乱跑，而不考虑队友。如果你这样做，你会造成石头叠在一起并且伤害到你的队友。不要惊慌！一旦这个阶段结束，就像平常一样继续战斗。

* **「分裂」** : 这就是事情变得棘手的地方。这个Boss有两种非常简单的机制......熔岩池和重型攻击，它们将在整个战斗中以恒定的频率发生。简单重复，没错吧？嗯，是的，也不是。单独处理这些机制是很容易的，但当然著名的迈克·芬尼根不会让它那么简单，对吧？...不会的。

在血量达到80%时，Boss将分裂成两个，一个大的和一个小的。他们现在各自拥有自己的生命条，但他们共享总体Boss的健康百分比。这个新的Boss可以做与上一个相同的事情。所以，是的，现在你需要应对两次重击和潜在的两次沉默！房间现在变得有些令人感到幽闭恐怖，因为熔岩充满了整个房间！你现在应该尝试专注于攻击新的Boss，同时仍然要伤害主要的那个！

在总血量达到50％时，第三个BOSS将出现！这个BOSS要小得多，血量较少，是的，现在血条已经分成了3个BOSS...而且你猜对了，现在你必须应对3次重击作为坦克，以及3次熔岩池施放，因为每个BOSS都是其他的完全复制品！

现在我们来看看攻略。老板活得越久，他们施放AOE的次数也会增加，重击的次数也会增加。因此，你希望尽可能缩小距离，尽快击败这些额外的老板，这样你就不必应对太多的堆叠机制。

* **因此保留你的终极技能不要用核弹开始当第二个boss出现时使用你的终极技能以便更快地压缩80** : 50％的差距。这意味着你有两个独立的boss在一起的时间更少，因此它们不会同时出现太多重叠的重击和熔岩池（它们在一起的时间越长，战斗就越长，房间就会被填满）。

推进第三个首领出现在房间里会减少你处理过多事物的时间。这确实会强制让所有三个首领出现并强制你现在有了3个重叠的机制，但如果做得足够快和高效，你还没有足够的时间填满房间的岩浆，这意味着你现在可以承受来自boss的额外施法，因为你有更多的空间而不是在耐心等待过程中。

首先击败小BOSS（他一出现就几乎进入执行范围，他的生命很少）。这意味着第三个重叠现在已经消失，然后集中攻击中间的BOSS，最后留下的应该是你一开始攻击的第一个BOSS。

如果您按下2和3来快速出现，然后再按下它们来快速消灭，那么您可以在最后一个机制上花费任意长的时间，因为只剩下一个熔岩机制。

输出伤害在这场战斗中当然可以起到帮助的作用，但是战术上选择正确的目标，选择最佳时机和最佳技能释放位置的战术伤害应用（无论队伍中有多少DPS）是使战斗更加顺利的关键。

注意：无论还有多少个首领存活，“雨”机制仍将发生，但它会随机从其中一个首领身上发生，而不是所有三个。

了解游戏机制并且理解它们，祝好运！

> This boss is about as simple as it gets mechanics wise but they are VERY punishing if you get the wrong. The tank needs to maintain a taunt at ALL times. The boss and keep it turned away from the group for the entire fight!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss stand up on his back legs and launch a HUGE hitting cone aoe heavy attack in the direction of whoever has agro. This should always be the tank. The tank must BLOCK this. If not he/she is dead in one shot, it hits incredibly hard!
> 
> If for any strange reason the boss aims at a dps or a healer during this heavy attack they must apply a well timed dodge roll or they will be killed, a dps/healer CANNOT block this hit, it is way too strong designed for tanks to mitigate.
> 
> **Minions** - During the fight waves of adds will spawn and must be dealt with. The tank can root the enemies and taunt them in order to control them BUT at the same time must maintain a taunt on the boss and not spin the boss on the group. These adds will spawn at set percentages of the boss's health (75% 50% and 25%) so over burning the boss damage wise, will result in overlapping of the adds and you can get overwhelmed with multiple spawns. These also do heavy attack so the group must be careful if they get focused (these can be blocked).
> 
> If you get overwhelmed with adds do NOT start running away! This will NOT help, let the tank try to control them. Running away will NOT make you loose agro on anything that is chasing you and they WILL chase you until they die. Don't PANIC!
> 
> This is quite easy to work with. Simply get inside the shield and stack and burn the boss.

> 
> This boss can be a tricky one and requires some solid co-ordination and quick thinking from the tank! The tank should keep the boss agroed and faced at him/her as much as possible while taunts are able to land (she becomes immune to it during the fight). This is fairly mobile to some extent so people must not panic and must not start running away like a headless chicken. The trick to this fight is add control and focus!
> 
> **Forrest** - During the fight the boss will become Immune and put up a force field of trees around her. As soon as you see her casting to make this force field go up you must leave the area immediately in order to avoid the knock back and knock down mechanic you will receive for touching the shield. Get OUT! asap! When she is shielded she is immune to all damage and taunts and will select players to hit (more explained below). Once the phase is over, she will teleport to a new location and you can attack her again. This mechanic is rinse repeated throughout the whole fight.
> 
> NOTE: This phase happens at 75% 50% and 30%.
> 
> **Adds** - During the shield phase adds will spawn and the tank must grab them as fast as possible and turn them away from the group! This is when you need as dps to focus the adds not the boss (boss is immune to all damage and taunts) The bear add, above all, must be focused. If this thing hits a dps/healer with it's heavy attack they will die to a one shot even if they block. The tank must block the attack and others must stay out of it. The bear is almost the same as the previous boss just much less health. Once the adds are down go back to the boss and/or wait for her to leave here shield of trees and teleport to a new location.
> 
> **Winters Grasp** - During the shield phase while you are dealing with the adds, the taunt WILL drop off of the boss. This is when she chooses a player at random (usually a dps) to fire nasty fast moving aoes across the ground. This cold based aoe deals MASSIVE damage and an immobilize. The immobilize part is only really relevant if hitting a tank since a tank would survive it. DPS and/or healers will die to pretty much a one shot. During this agro phase on her chosen target she will also fire light attacks at the same target. This player must have heals focused on them and also move OUT of the aoe when it is aimed at them. Try to find a spot where no one else is standing and just simply watch your feet. Standing near others runs the risk of multiple players getting caught by it and inevitably causing a wipe.
> 
> **Blast** - The boss will cast a MASSIVE thin cone aoe in the direction of whoever has agro during the fight. The is a blast of rocks/nirncrux type damage and will hit fairly hard and knockback/down anyone caught in it. A tank can block it but others must dodge roll it to get out.
> 
> **Stranglers** - During the shield phases, while killing the adds, stranglers will spawn and these MUST be dealt with fast else you will end up filling the room with poison and your group will take HUGE damage (explained prior to the boss IN the video).
> 
> 
> 
> Stoneheart
> 
> 
> ** STONEHEART **
> 
> This boss is actually pretty mobile as fights go with a lot of moving around. The tank needs to keep a taunt on the boss at all times. The group need to be very aware of their feet in this fight as there is a lot of awkward ground aoe type damage to deal with.
> 
> **Fire circle** - During the fight each time the boss teleports to a new location, it will cast 3 light attacks at whoever has agro (should be the tank) each light attack will place a circle of fire on the ground and should be avoided! It won't necessarily one shot you if you stand in it for a brief moment but the damage is very high if you stand in it for more than a second, so try NOT to stand in these. They will disappear after a short time.
> 
> **Atronachs** - After each full rotation of mechanics the boss raise his hand in the air and lots of red flying projectiles will go from his staff to a random Stone Atronach in the room. THEN he will teleport to a random location. These Atronachs MUST be focused down as soon as possible. If you do not kill them fast enough they will enrage and put nasty circles of nirncrux underneath each player every second over and over doing HIGH damage to anyone caught in them until it is dead. If you keep moving these can be placed on the ground and/or kited (like the Domihaus mechanics) but of course eventually they will catch you and kill you. So it is crucial that the Atronach dies in order to defeat this mechanic from wiping your group.
> 
> **Space Invaders!!** - The best way i can describe this mechanic is 'space invaders!'. Basically the boss will squat and LOADS of very small fast moving aoes will fly around the floor aiming at the group members over and over until he has finished channeling this effect. Basically this is where old school space invader training comes in and you basically just have to wiggle between them and avoid being hit. Simple left right left right movements to avoid them will be just fine. DO NOT sprint around the room because of course you will overlap to many of them and kill people. Relax, wiggle a bit, and then carry on. If these hit you they can take as much as 30-40% health per hit, so be careful!
> 
> **Root** - While the boss is under 25% health he will start rooting the players in vines so their feet are stuck to the ground. If you stay inside this mechanic for the full duration, once it has finished it will burst and you will take HIGH damage. The way to defeat this mechanic is simply to dodge roll to break out of it when you see the effect. So for magicka users above all, do NOT sprint around the room too much, you will need your resources to avoid this mechanic.

> This boss is the pug killer and most player's worst nightmare! Small fighting area and LOTS of major already taught mechanics, in ONE fight! The tank must NOT drop taunt on this boss under any circumstances if they can help it. Sure the tank should never drop the boss anyway, that is bad practice...but this one will issue wipes SO fast!
> 
> **Heavy attack eruption!** - The boss will fire off a heavy attack with a massive swing of his weapon EXACTLY the same as the mechanics from the other Minotaurs in the dungeon, where once the heavy has landed, a tiny aoe will be placed in the floor in the position in which hi hit and a volcano eruption type mechanic will rapidly spew from it's position. The tank MUST stand on this and plug the hole while holding block!
> 
> **Swing** - The boss (normally after his heavy attack) will swing in frontal aoe at the person with agro and 3 small fire aoes will emit from this attack. Simply step out of these, they are the same sice as the space invader aoes and do about the same damage.
> 
> **Shalks** - If you have got this far you SHOULD by now have understood this mechanic, but i will explain it anyway. Throughout the fight Shalks will spawn and they need to be focused. These Shalks will target an individual with a negative aoe chasing them around until it catches them and then on impact will explode and hit them with a terribly aggressive fire damage over time (note most people will never live through this even with big heals). If YOU are the Shalk's target, you will get a message on your screen and your screen will have flames around the edges. This is when you must RUN away and jump onto one of the platforms in the lava. Once the aoe following your dissolves in the lava you can jump off and come back into the fight. You MUST get rid of this effect, do not try to tank it, you will die. You should have up to 5 of these from start to finish in the fight. Depending on how fast you kill the boss.
> 
> **Atronachs** - Once the boss hits 50% he will wake up the Stone Atronachs in the room, one per phase. These are identical to the ones in the previous boss fight (explained above) and must be killed as soon as possible. Failure to do so will cause them to cast aoes under the feet of each player and you will have to constantly move to avoid them while also placing them on the floor making it very difficult to stand anywhere without dying. These Atronachs MUST be killed asap at all costs.
> 
> **BIG BOOM!** - The boss will pound his weapon into the ground and an ENORMOUS aoe will spread rapidly around the entire platform! This is when every single member must run away and jump onto one of the platforms/rocks surrounding the area. Once the aoe explodes and all the fire is gone you can jump off and come back into the room again, however some things to note.
> 
> When the aoe is gone but the fire is still present do NOT jump in, the fire will one shot you.
> 
> Also the pads/rocks/platforms...they can only take a certain amount of timed pressure (player standing on them) per pad. SO if one person uses it of course over time it will pop and disappear, BUT if multiple players stand on them, it applies more pressure and they will disappear SOONER! One pad per person or else #RIP!
> 
> If you do not get to a pad you will die, if you jump back in too soon (fire still present) you will die, and if you get greedy and use more than one person to a pad, you will of course inevitably die in the lava. Focus and co-ordinate!

> 
> This boss is actually 3 bosses and they MUST be controlled. The tank should keep a taunt on these at all times! The bull will stand where e wants and is quite stubborn so it is safer to taunt him in the face and hold him still. The melee boss will come to the tank if taunted since he is melee and therefore can also be easily stacked on the bull but the healer/ranged boss won't come to you unless you are out of her range with agro (tank taunting 101, basically get out of their range and they will move to you until they can reach). With this in mind, grab both Bull and melee add with taunts and taunt the ranged too. Run backwards to bring the ranged boss in a bit and then run back to HER with the two melee dps for a nice easy stack. This is demonstrated in the video.
> 
> **Chains** - The Minotaur has the same mechanics as some of the ones you have encountered in the dungeon so far but it is crucial that you pay attention. The boss will pin 2 members of the group with chains and then a spreading aoe will appear under their feet. The boss MUST be interrupted to break the chains and the people pinned (now set free) MUST move out of the aoe. The chains maybe released but the aoe will still explode. failure to interrupt or get out of danger once the interrupt is initiated will result in a borderline one shot!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The Minotaur and the melee boss can both heavy attack. These must be blocked by the tank else he/she will be knocked back/down and quite possibly killed!
> 
> **Burst!** - The Melee boss will cast a MASSIVE spreading aoe on the group centered from himself. This must be avoided. If you don't get out of range of it before it bursts you will take HUGE damage and be stunned if it didn't already kill you. Which means you would have to break free. Overlapping these mechanics all above and failure to interrupt one target while this stun aoe hits is a catastrophe, focus!
> 
> **Heal** - The ranged Boss (mage) can heal the other two and herself. This should be interrupted as soon as it is spotted.
> 
> **Elemental attacks** - The mage has many short duration channel abilities which cause damage to the group in the form of both direct and aoe damage depending on which one she is performing at the time. These can be interrupted. She is probably the easiest boss of the 3 if controlled but she MUST be interrupted. So long as you interrupt her every time you see her casting...Healing and damage dealing for her is almost impossible. So a very simple boss if you are paying attention.
> 
> Above all, these 3 need to be killed as fast as possible and stacking is your safest bet. Stack all 3 together, don't drop taunts and interrupt the mechanics at ALL costs. Focus down the bull first to get rid of the chain mechanic, get rid of the melee boss afterwards since you only then have to deal with heavy attacks and the aoe, and then finally kill the mage. DO NOT sit near the middle of the room as lava pools will spread from the center and kill you (they stun/cc if you are hit with 3 rock hits in a row from the nirncrux/lava).

Basically if you can tank the axes (up to 3) in Aetherian Archive, you are pretty much capable. If not, get more practice. You have ZERO room for error here. Positioning, co-ordination are key for the group but above all the tank MUST pay attention.
> 
> **Heavy attack!** - his is a simple as it gets. The boss will fire off a HUGE heavy attack. If the tank is blocking, they will survive, if not they are dead. If this hits a dps/healer player while blocking, they will die anyway. It is a very hard hit, you need the mitigation a tank can bring. So if something goes horribly wrong and the tank ends up dropping the boss, and you as a dps or healer have agro, your only chance is to dodge roll...do NOT run away or start legging it around the room, he will still catch you, you will still die, and someone will have to pick you up because you made a mess of it. Simply DODGE at the right time so the tank can recover.
> 
> **Lava/nirncrux pool!** - THIS is possibly the most important mechanic in the fight. The boss will channel with his hand into the ground in the direction of HIS CHOICE and a fire/nirncrux trail will shoot across the floor and emit a pool of lava/nirncrux. This can be close, it could be far but whatever happens do NOT touch it and do NOT stay close to it! If you stay close to it you will take damage every second from projectiles spewing from it. 3 hits in a row will fossilize you and you i will be stunned while still taking damage and die! Most people will die before that even happens so simply stay the hell away from this stuff!
> 
> This can land ANYWHERE so keep your wits about you. Sometimes you can get lucky and it can fire all around the outside of the room, other times it can be close by. The tank needs to be the one to control the boss during this mechanic. If the lava is a long way away, keep tanking the boss where he is. If not and it is too close to you, then be sure to reposition the boss and move together as a group.
> 
> **Rocks** - During the fight rocks will fall from the ceiling, be sure to step out of these or they will issue HIGH damage if you are not a tank.
> 
> **Rain!** - The boss will go Immune during the fight at stages and when he is immune he will cause rocks to rain from the sky. Each player will have rocks aimed directly at them and must move out of the aoes before they land. This is fairly easy to avoid but try to find your own space and not run around like a headless chicken not considering your team mates. If you do this you will end up stacking them and killing your friends. DON'T PANIC! Once the phase is over carry on as normal.
> 
> **The Split!** - This is where things get tricky. The boss has two very simple mechanics...The lava pool and the heavy attack, and these will happen at a steady pace through out the fight. Rinse repeat right? Well yes and no. This is something that is easily manageable on it's own but of course the famous Mike Finnigan would not make it THAT simple would he?...no.
> 
> At 80% the boss will split into two, so a large one and a smaller one. They now both have their own Health bars but they SHARE the overall boss health percentage. This NEW boss can do exactly the same as the last one. So yes, NOW you have 2x heavy attacks to deal with as the tank and a potential 2x lava pool placements! The room is now getting a little, claustrophobic with all the lava filling the room! You should now try to focus the new boss while still damaging the main one!
> 
> At 50% OVERALL! a third boss will appear! a much smaller one with less health and yes now the health bar is split across all 3x bosses...And you guess it, you now have 3x heavy attacks to deal with as the tank and 3x lava pool casts because each boss is an exact duplicate of the other!
> 
> NOW here comes the tactic. The longer the bosses are alive the more often they will cast aoes and the more often they will heavy attack..SO you want to close the gap as much as possible and get those additional bosses down as soon as you can so that you don't have to deal with so many stacking mechanics.
> 
> SO, SAVE your ultimates. Do not start with a nuke. Use your ultimates when the SECOND boss appears in order to push the 80-50% gap faster. This means that you have 2 bosses on their own for less time so that they do not both together have too much opportunity to overlap heavy attacks and lava pools (the longer they are together the longer the fight and the more the room gets filled).
> 
> Pushing for the 3rd boss to appear in the room lessens the time you have to deal with so much going on. This does FORCE all 3 to appear and FORCE you to have now 3 over lapping mechanics, but if done fast enough and efficiently enough you will not have had enough time to yet fill the room with lava, meaning you can now afford the additional casts from the bosses to do their thing since you have more space than taking your time.
> 
> Kill the small boss first (he will be almost in execute range as he comes out, he has very little health. Meaning the 3rd overlap is now gone, then focus the middle one and then finally the last man standing should be the first boss you started with.
> 
> If you push 2 and 3 to appear fast and then push them to die fast, you can take as long as you like on the last one because only ONE lava mechanic is left.
> 
> Damage output can of course play a contributing role in this fight to make things easier, BUT tactical damage application (regardless of dps amount in the group) in the way of strategically selecting your targets for the right timing and placing of your ultimates is what makes the fight much smoother.
> 
> NOTE: The 'Rain' Mechanic will still take place regardless of how many bosses are alive BUT it will randomly happen from ONE of them, not all 3.
> 
> Learn the mechanics and above all understand them, best of luck!!
