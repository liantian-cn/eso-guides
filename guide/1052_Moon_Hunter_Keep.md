### 狱卒梅利图斯

> JAILER MELITUS


** 狱卒梅利图斯 **

这个首领非常简单，相对于一些更大的首领，它的生命值相对较低，但事情可能会非常混乱。如果你的小队有高DPS，请非常小心，因为你会很快地重叠机制！坦克应该保持首领在房间中央静止，并始终将其背向小队。不要在房间里四处奔跑。小组的其余成员应该呈宽阔的半圆形排列，并相互远离。这是关键！

* **突然爆炸并发出弹跳声** :  Boss会释放一个巨大的持续伤害范围技能。这个范围会逐渐扩大并在爆炸时发射数个小的、快速移动的范围技能，扑向团队成员。这是关键，因为这些技能的伤害很高，有可能会导致团队灭亡。应对这个机制的方法是（如上所述）保持队员分散。远离巨大的持续伤害范围技能，当它爆炸时，准备好左右移动以避免目标圆圈对你的打击。

如果你们集中在一起，范围攻击当然会杀死你的小组，因为你们都会受到同样的攻击。互相拥抱并不是一个选项。不要这么做。

* **鲜血喷泉** :  BOSS会在每个玩家脚下施放大型的鲜血喷泉。不要堆叠在一起，因为它们最终会聚集到同一位置，你会毁掉整个队伍！

当每个玩家身下出现这些大面积AOE时，他们需要赶紧躲开它！这将在你移动时多次生成，直到所有的血泉都被生成。然后你可以重新排列阵型，等待下一个机制的到来。

* **重点是不要惊慌不要堆叠并保持远离傻瓜如果你被击中你将承受高伤害并被束缚束缚约在60** : 70%，你的速度非常慢，这意味着移动远离下一个来临的爆发几乎不可能，最终会导致你死亡。不要以自我为中心地拥抱你的朋友。保持彼此间的距离！

* **增援** :  首领会在房间内召唤增援（狼人），这些必须处理掉。这就是高 dps 与重叠机制会变得危险的地方。增援将从80%的地方开始出现，然后在51%和31%左右出现。狼人有大范围的aoe效果需要避免，还有一个超级大的跳跃重击，即使格挡也会秒杀一个dps！坦克必须尽快去抓住这些，而整个小组应该把重心放在这些增援上，而不是首领。

大约在20%的时候，弓箭手也会出现，并且它们可能会加剧混乱，所以在这个阶段，根据你的伤害输出，你可以结束BOSS或者集中击杀小怪来控制节奏。但最重要的是，坦克必须抓住这些小怪并将它们放置在恰当的位置并招引它们，以防小组被复杂机制压垮。

* **一击必杀（打断或死亡）** :  这个boss有时会充能一个可以被打断的效果。咏唱时间约为2-3秒，比较长，但这一定要被打断。效果总是会瞄准仇恨目标（坦克），会将其定身，使其无法与boss互动，所以你和你的团队必须准备好。如果你没能在攻击期间打断boss，无论坦克的血量有多少，boss都会完成重击并直接杀死坦克。





### 树篱迷宫守护者

> HEDGE MAZE GUARDIAN


【攻略翻译】** 迷宫守卫 **

这场战斗实际上相当简单，但有时在PUG团队中会让它看起来比必要的困难得多。坦克应该将首领放置在房间中央，并避免靠近边缘。将首领背对团队并固定在原地！同时，你应该分成两个团队。坦克和治疗师是第1小队，2名DPS是第2小队！记住这一点，并一起运作机制。

* **定身** :  这个Boss会定身所有队员，如果定身效果在时间结束前消失，队员们将会承受巨大的伤害和/或死亡。解决这个问题的方法是在它杀死你之前简单地闪避机制。

* **重攻击** :  Boss会对拥有仇恨的对象进行重攻击（应该是坦克），维持一个嘲讽并不难。简单地格挡这个攻击，否则你会承受巨大的伤害甚至死亡。

* **Cleave** :  这个BOSS会释放一个巨大的横劈效果，作用范围从房间中心到边缘的距离非常大。如果你是dps/治疗，最好避开此攻击，坦克可以用盾牌格挡。如果dps满血，不会立即死亡，但会受到大量伤害。横劈效果持续时间比较长，不易判断，为了方便起见，建议尽量避开此攻击。

* **扼杀者** :  这非常关键！扼杀者到处都是，迷宫里，房间的边缘都有它们的身影。它们会抓住最近的目标并将其固定，同时耗尽其生命值。如果不打断它们，玩家将最终会死亡，或被boss击晕...这当然会导致相同的结果。这就是为什么你必须在房间中央去坦住boss的原因。

团队一（治疗和坦克）待在房间中央，整个战斗他们将绝不与袭击者交互。

然而，第二组（2x dps）必须始终在一起，因为他们会在迷宫和房间中奔跑，并与流浪者互动。如果他们靠得太近，他们将会钉住团队中的一名成员，你的另一名成员应该在此时打断他们。像视频中展示的那样共同合作，这些问题将永远不会成为问题。如果正确执行，这是一个管理机制的轻而易举的过程，但如果你有自私的炫耀性玩家，那么这将是一个惨败的节日。共同合作！

* **鬼灵** :  由第二个队负责！如果Boss一直被治愈，就无法杀死它。在整个战斗过程中，房间周围的 Spriggans 将迅速治愈 Boss。因此，第二个团队需要一起前往每个 Spriggan 并将其杀死，以阻止其治愈。通常一次出现两只。所以一起行动，将它们打倒，死后回到 Boss 面前。如前面机制所述，必须同时呆在一起。在每个 Spriggan 附近都有一只 Strangler，它们会将你们中的一人固定直到死亡。你必须互相帮助。

在战斗中，石灵精灵会越来越深入迷宫中，希望你有很好的导航技能！

所有Spriggan的阶段都落下来后，你就可以消灭Boss了（大约还剩30%的健康值）。





### 米伦尼·唤月者

> MYLENNE MOON-CALLER


**米伦尼·唤月者**

如果玩家不注意，这个BOSS可能会成为噩梦！所以要小心并注意脚下！

坦克应该将BOSS保持在房间中央，或至少保持其静止并将其背向团队。千万不要放下嘲讽技能，否则团队将全灭。

* **猛爪袭击** :  这个Boss偶尔会对一个随机玩家进行猛扑 (通常是距离最远的，但不总是）。当这种情况发生时，Boss将试图撕裂倒在地上的人。这时必须打断Boss的攻击来救援被困住的玩家。如果你不够快，你的队友会受到大约200-300K的伤害而死。这也可能会发生在坦克身上，所以一定要小心!基本机制非常关键，必须进行“打断”才能生存！

* **重击** :  首领会朝着拥有仇恨的人发动一次非常恶毒的重击攻击。当然，这个人应该永远是坦克，所以坦克应该格挡这个攻击。然而，如果出现首领对其他玩家（输出/治疗）使用重击的情况，您必须计时并翻滚躲避这个攻击。作为治疗/输出，您不应该格挡这个攻击……这会让你死掉。

* **狼** :  在战斗中，从80%开始，每20%会出现3只狼。它们可以被嘲讽减益，但并不总是会受到嘲讽的影响，并会攻击任何它们想攻击的角色。它们还可以被激怒，所以要小心。作为DPS/治疗师，如果它们在追你，请不要在房间里乱跑。狼应该优先被消灭而不是首领。然而，坦克可以用链式技能控制它们并将它们定身，因此在控制增援时，“时间停止”也是一种选择。击杀狼后回到首领。

* **典狱长** :  不要惊慌！我见过很多约战队伍的玩家看到他们要么忽略它们，要么在房间里绕圈子。小贴士：这两种方法都不奏效！

典狱长会在战斗过程中每次同时出现两个（第一个刷新出来的只有一个），同时与狼一同出现，它们是你优先攻击的目标。它们会释放毒瘤般的闪电攻击并干扰战斗机制。

现在，我们将它分解一下。他们会在地面上放置一个巨大的 AOE（他们会引导然后释放），要远离这个大的 AOE。他们还会在地面上释放闪电，你必须避开它（只需一直移动脚，这样就不会被击中）。最后，闪电箭将从天上降下。这些下降得非常快，下一发射击也同样迅速。

当这种情况发生时，每个玩家都会有自己的闪电箭头，所以请在一个漂亮的小圆圈内移动（只有几英尺左右），并不停地移动，直到它们消失为止。不要互相追逐，也不要堆叠在一起。如果这样做，多个玩家会把自己的效果叠加在其他玩家身上，他们就会双倍叠加并死亡！

你们一定要分开。

首先，在再次攻击首领之前，所有守卫都必须集中注意力。在此期间，坦克需要保持对任何出现的添加物的控制，并注意保持对首领的仇恨控制，不要让那只狗逃脱！放松心情，一起关注机制！





### 档案管理员厄纳尔德

> ARCHIVIST ERNARDE


**档案管理员厄纳尔德**

这个臭名昭著的PUG杀手，准备好了，实际上这并没有看起来那么糟糕，但你必须集中注意力，重视清晰的机制。坦克应该一直保持对Boss的仇恨，但坦克通常不需要靠近Boss。只要让他忙碌，专注于你在这场战斗中的关键角色。以下是说明。DPS需要站在Boss周围分散成半个圆形，并随时准备移动他们的脚。

* **注意** :  这些是你的主要优先目标！开始有两个“add”。其中一个可能会变成一只巨大的狼人，他们的攻击非常痛苦。坦克应该把这两只“add”带到房间的左边或右边靠近楼梯的角落里，并尽快让它们面对着墙壁。团队需要集中注意力尽可能快地击杀它们。如果你的伤害非常高和/或使用了你的终极技能，有时可以在它们变身之前杀死它们。然而，坦克需要把它们逼到角落里。霍非（也被称为巨型狼人）不会留情，他的技能需要被理解。坦克必须格挡他所做的跺脚动作，并且呼吸不能对着团队喷洒。如果一个跺脚AOE即将到来，其余的团队必须走开，否则就会一招致命。

简而言之，集中对付那些小怪，忽略对BOSS的伤害（只需确保它被嘲讽住）。这些小怪会根据BOSS的血量一遍遍地刷新（因此请确保不要快速地攻击BOSS，除非你确实能掌控住）。耐心点，没有什么好着急的！

在76%、56%和36%时会刷出小怪，包括一开始的小怪在内共有4波。如果需要，可以慢慢来。

* **闪电** :  首领会对小组中的一个成员发动重击，导致散开的范围攻击。一旦它达到最大尺寸，就会爆炸。带有该范围攻击的玩家应该移动到一侧，并避免重叠在小组上，直到它消失，否则会冒着团队灭亡的风险。简单地移动，让它弹出，然后重新进场。

* **盾牌** :  这个游戏机制是指首领会随机选取一个玩家，然后将其悬浮在空中，并给予他一个盾牌。玩家需要通过团队的伤害打破盾牌以释放玩家。如果你没有及时击败盾牌，它将会爆炸并导致玩家死亡。

* **符文轮盘** :  这个机制一旦了解就非常简单，就像大多数事情一样，但乍一看非常令人困惑。别担心，它并没有你想象的那么糟糕。

首领头顶上方会轮流显示符文序列。他在决定想要哪个符文。你会看到房间周围有12个带有圆圈的符号。

现在，游戏变得简单了，但你必须快速行动......一旦他做出选择，符号将保持稳定。房间里与他的符号相同的每个符号都会亮起明显的圆形光芒，并且当然会有符文可见。

当这种情况发生时，你们所有人都需要去收集一种符号。房间里有每种符号4个，所以一定要找对了。在走廊的左右两侧，楼梯左右两侧以及楼梯的顶部都有符号（在视频中展示，观察坦克）。

如果多于一个人站在同一个房间里，第二个到达的人将会死亡，去找自己的房间吧！

同时注意，在这个阶段，首领和任何小怪（如果有的话）都会被冻结在原地，所以只要你留在符文内，你仍然可以造成伤害并且如果需要的话可以救活队友。

简而言之…看他选择了哪个，找到与之匹配的自己的那个……站在里面等爆炸发生，然后像往常一样继续进行。失败将导致一次毙命。

这种机制其实比它看起来要简单得多，一旦你理解了它，就会非常重要，特别是面对最终Boss的困难模式。所以务必学会它 ;)





### 崛起的维科萨

> VYKOSA THE ASCENDANT


**崛起的维科萨（又名猫狗）**

这个首领非常难缠，但希望这个攻略能对你有所帮助。这个战斗的危险在于人们“过度燃烧”机制，堆积过多和/或不协调。你需要根据机制的时间来使用你的技能和终极技等。这不是一场燃烧节。坦克应该把boss控制在她开始的位置附近，并把它转向远离小组的方向。不要放弃boss的嘲讽！

* **把它拴住** :  这个战斗中有两只狼宠物，一只红色的，一只灰色的。它们通过狗链/铁链与墙壁相连。然而，狗链长度是固定的，并且它们是共享的。因此，如果坦克嘲讽它们两只，它们最多只能到达中央位置，但是如果您拉一只，另一只的链子会变短。所以这个技巧是让坦克嘲讽一只（灰色的），然后让红色的保持不动，让小组专注击杀它。它们两只有相同的机制，都需要注意。

游戏攻略翻译如下：
团队中的输出角色应该始终专注于左侧的红色狼。需要注意的是，如果这只狼试图“扑跃”，你必须进行闪避或接受一次致命打击。此外，如果它试图重击你，你必须向后进行闪避。不要聚在一起，否则几个人都会被困住，但如果你以不同的方向闪避，它会跟随你并旋转杀死你和其他人。一旦红色狼死了，去找坦克并击杀剩下的狼。它们将蜷缩在角落里一段时间，稍后再次回到战斗状态。

这些是优先攻击目标。先攻击红色的，其次是灰色的，不管怎样都不能让它们活着！

警告: 当boss的生命值剩余20%时，两只狼将脱离 他们的绳索，尽快击杀它们!

* **重击** :  头目将对坦克进行重击。这需要格挡，否则会造成致命伤害。如果它攻击小队成员，则必须进行闪避或死亡，但这应该始终攻击坦克，除非坦克失去了嘲讽（他们不应该）。

* **流血** :  Boss将对坦克造成一些恶毒的流血效果，因此治疗师必须时刻关注治疗，否则你将很快被清空。高强度治疗是关键!

* **火焰** :  这很容易发现。维科萨会造成一个小范围火焰爆炸，击中地面。这可以通过她把她的法杖举到空中而显示出来。简单地不要站在上面，等待它过去。站在里面会对任何在内的人造成高伤害。

* **恐惧图腾** :  BOSS会在地面上放置一种中等大小的圆形AOE，并在中央放置一个图腾。这将会使玩家陷入恐惧状态，想要摆脱它就必须挣脱。注意保持体力，不要站在AOE内！如果BOSS的恐惧图腾落在坦克身上，他们可能需要重新调整BOSS的方向，向左或向右，以避免长时间故意待在图腾范围内。

* **猛爪袭击** :  她会像地牢中的中间BOSS一样扑向坦克或获得仇恨的人。当这种情况发生时，必须打断她，否则被压制的人会被咀嚼并杀死！务必注意打断机制！

* **绞杀者** :  你在地牢中已经见过这些，应该知道它们的工作原理。然而，在70％时，房间被“绞杀者”包围。始终让坦克附近有点数以便击杀它们。它们当然会重新站起来，但它们的生命值非常低，可以很容易地进入“坐下”状态。这将防止不必要的昏迷。同时，作为输出和治疗者，尽可能远离房间的边缘，如果你确实到达那里，请保持你的点数以避免被“绞杀者”压倒。

* **狼群** :  这是一个非常重要的机制！在特定生命值的百分比下，BOSS将会召唤2只小怪，并且短时间内会召唤另外2-3只！它们可以并且会重叠出现！

你在整个地牢中看到的狼人...你知道那些一击必杀你的家伙吗？他们会大举而来！

* **90％的几率你会遇到两只狼

50%（关于典狱长机制见下）2只狼

* **46** : 45% 2只狼

这里是一个游戏进度提示。意思是任务完成度在46%到45%之间，需要击败两只狼。

30% 双倍狼人

25%几率出现2只狼

这些BOSS的窍门是专注于并甚至为这些阶段存储你的终极技能。你可以真正放慢伤害并逐阶段建立终极技能。但请记住他们是狼人，所以你会因为格斗行会的被动技能在杀死他们时获得终极技能回复。

另外一个非常重要的技巧是控制技能（CC）。你的坦克可以用嘲讽技能牵制敌人（顺便说一下，在面对如此多的目标和海量伤害时，这是极具挑战性的），但是你作为一个小组可以准备足够多的“时间停止”技能，如视频所示，来控制敌人。

优先攻击这些狼！如果它们发出重击，你作为DPS或治疗必须进行闪避来躲避，否则就会死亡（在视频中也有演示）。

* **典狱长** :  这是一个非常棘手的阶段。你不仅要应对已经出现的机制，而且在50%的时候会有典狱长加入战斗。因此，作为狼人包的一部分，你还必须处理这些问题。就像地牢的中间boss一样，典狱长现在是首要目标！

这就是你想改变团队位置的地方。你不再让所有的狼都去攻击坦克，并扔掉终极技能和时间停止技能（控制技能），而是要跑到刚出生的典狱长跟前，将他聚焦击败。他们有与以前战斗中的典狱长相同的机制（闪电飞溅、地上的区域攻击和愤怒类型机制，其中它们会造成更多伤害），所以你应该已经熟悉了这些机制。他们必须死，甚至在狼之前！不惜一切代价除掉他们。

* **它们会在设定的血量检查点同时生成两只它们的生成分别为50、4645、30和25最后一次在大约21** : 20%时生成1只。一定要一直集中攻击它们，并注意躲避它们的攻击。同时不要在同一位置攻击。

* **档案管理员厄纳尔德** :  他回来了！！

在30%的时候，上一个首领的幽灵将以完整的机制进入房间！他会施放持续攻击，制造一个扩散的范围伤害，就像上次战斗中那样。不要堆在一起，到安全区域等待它消失，这样你就不会重叠，杀死你的队友。

首先，"符文轮盘"不在这个房间里！每一分钟，他会开始选择一个符文。当他选择完毕后，你们四个必须找到与他选择的符文相匹配的一个符文并站在上面，否则就会死亡！

提示：小心不要尝试在他身边或穿过他附近奔跑（他是房间中间的紫色人物），他的攻击范围很大，正如视频所显示的，你可能会卡在他身上，最终因为无法及时到达符文而死亡。

最后：

记住这些机制，并按照顺序实践，你就会没问题了，但你需要完全理解它们。

放松心态，注意协作，团队合作才能完成，只有一个人玩的玩家是无法完成的。

这不是一个持续攻击的战斗，你可以控制节奏。当狼群、典狱长们以及两只狼狗都被消灭后，当老板的生命值在20%以下时，你需要集中精力攻击老板。

放松，慌乱只会导致人死亡，它只有死了才算死。关注机制并祝你好运！

> This boss is very simple with relatively low health in comparison to some of the larger bosses but things can get messy FAST. IF you have high dps in your group be extremely careful because you will overlap mechanics really quickly! The tank should hold the boss still in the middle of the room and turn him away from the group at all times. do NOT run around the room. The rest of the group should be in a wide semi circle formation and stay AWAY from each other. This is KEY!
> 
> **Burst and pop!** - The boss will spawn a LARGE spreading aoe which does HUGE damage. This aoe grows and then pops launching several small fast moving aoes in the direction of the members of the group. This is key since these hit really hard and can potentially wipe the group. The way to manage this mechanic is to (as stated above) STAY spread out. Move away from the large growing aoe and when it bursts be ready to move left or right to avoid the floor circle coming at you.
> 
> IF you stack up, the aoe will of course kill your group because you will all be hit by the same thing. Hugging each other is NOT an option. Don't do it
> 
> **Blood Fountains**  - The boss will cast large blood fountains under the feet of EACH player. Do NOT stack because these WILL all end up in the same place and you will wipe the group guaranteed!
> 
> When these large aoes spawn under each player, they each need to move out of it! This will spawn several times each time you move until all of the blood fountains have spawned. Then you can get back into formation and relax awaiting the next mechanic.
> 
> Key point here is to NOT panic, NOT stack and simply stay out of stupid. If you get hit you will take high damage and be snared. The snare is around the 60-70% mark so you are incredibly slow meaning that moving away from the next incoming burst is pretty much not going to happen, inevitably killing you. Avoid these at all costs and don't selfishly hug your friends. Keep your distance from each other!
> 
> **Adds**  - The boss will spawn adds into the room (werewolves) and these MUST be dealt with. This is where overlapping mechanics with high dps gets risky. The adds will spawn around the 80% mark to start with and then at around 51% and about 31%. The werewolves have large aoe effects that need to be avoided and also have a HUGE jumping heavy attack which will one shot a dps even if blocking! The tank must grab these as fast as possible and the group should focus these over the boss.
> 
> At 20% or so Archers will also spawn and these can add to the mess so at this point depending on your damage output you can either finish the boss or focus adds and pace it. But above all, the tank must grab these and position/agro them before the group gets overwhelmed with mechanics.
> 
> **?ONE SHOT (interrupt or die)** - The boss sometimes charge up an interruptible effect. The channeling is about 2-3 seconds so is fairly long, BUT this must be interrupted. The effect will always be aiming at the tank/whoever has agro. This will pin them so they physically cannot interact with the boss so you MUST as a team be ready for this. If you fail to interrupt the boss during this attack, the boss will finish the heavy attack and kill the tank outright no matter how much health he/she has.

> HEDGE MAZE GUARDIAN
> 
> 
> ** HEDGE MAZE GUARDIAN **
> 
> This fight is actually pretty easy but is sometimes in PUGs made to look FAR more difficult than it has to be. The tank should position the boss in the middle of the room and avoid going anywhere near the edges. Turn the boss away from the group and hold it still! In the mean tim you should split into TWO teams. Tank and healer is team 1 and the 2x dps are team 2! Remember this and work together with the mechanics.
> 
> **Root** - The boss will root all members of the group and if the root expires after it's full duration each member will take HUGE damage and/or die. The way to fix this is to simply dodgeroll out of the mechanic before it kills you.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will heavy attack whoever has agro (should be the tank, it is NOT hard to maintain a taunt on a standing still boss). Simply block this, or take HUGE damage and/or die.
> 
> **Cleave** - This boss will cast a HUGE cleave effect, the best part of the distance from the middle to the edge of the entire room. Stay out of this if you are a dps/healer and simply block it as the tank. It wont kill a dps if they are full health but they will take a LOT of damage. It is quite a long effect so hard to judge. Make it easy on yourself and just avoid it.
> 
> **Stranglers** - THIS is crucial! Stranglers are all around the room, in the maze and around the edges of the room. These will grab the closest target and pin them while draining their health. If these are not interrupted the player will of course end up dead, or be smacked by the boss while stunned...which of course results in the same outcome. THIS is why you MUST tank the boss in the middle of the room.
> 
> Team 1 (healer and tank) stay in the middle of the room and they will NEVER interact with a strangler for the whole fight...
> 
> Team 2 however (the 2x dps) MUST stay together at all times because THEY will be running around in the maze and the room and WILL interact with the stranglers. They will pin one of the team members if they get too close and your other member should be the one to interrupt them when it happens. Work together (as shown in the video) and these will never be a problem. A breeze to manage mechanic if done correctly, but a WIPE FEST if you have selfish show off type players. Work together!
> 
> **Spriggans**  - Team 2 this is on you! The boss CANNOT be killed if it is being healed. Throughout the fight the Spriggans around the room will be healing the boss rapidly. So team 2 needs to go together to EACH Spriggan and kill it to stop it healing. Generally there are two at a time. So go together, get them down and when they are dead come back to the boss. I cannot stress this enough as explained in the previous mechanic, BOTH players must stay together. Near every Spriggan is a Strangler, and they WILL  pin one of you until you are dead. You must help each other.
> 
> During the fight the Spriggans will get deeper and deeper into the maze, i hope you have good navigation skills!
> 
> Once all the Spriggan phases are down, you can finish off the boss (around 30% health remaining).

> 
> This boss can be a NIGHTMARE if people do not pay attention! So be careful and watch your feet!
> 
> The tank should hold the boss pretty much in the middle of the room, or at least hold it still and turn it away from the group. Do NOT drop taunt for a second because you will wipe the group out.
> 
> **Pounce** - The boss will occasionally pounce on a random player player (usually the furthest away but not always). When this happens the boss will try to tear apart the person on the floor who is now pinned. This is where the boss MUST be interrupted to save the pinned player. If you are not fast enough your team mate will die to around 200-300k damage. This can happen to the tank as well so be careful! Base mechanics are key, 'interrupt' or die!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will throw out a nasty heavy attack at whoever has agro. This of course should always be the tank so the tank should BLOCK this. However if for some reason the boss is using this vs another player (dps/healer) you must time it and dodge roll the attack. You will NOT block this as a healer/dps...it will kill you.
> 
> **Wolves** - During the wolves will spawn in 3s every 20% starting from 80%. These can be debuffed with a taunt but don't always respond to taunts and will hit whoever they like, and they can also enrage so be careful. Do not run around the room if they are chasing you as a dps/healer. These should be focused down as a priority over the boss. The tank however can chain these in and root them so also of course 'time stop' IS an option here to control the adds. Kill the wolves then get back to the boss.
> 
> **Wardens** - DO NOT PANIC! I have seen many PUG sessions where people see these and either ignore them or run around the room in circles. Tip: neither works!
> 
> The wardens will spawn during the fight 2 at a time (excluding the first spawn which is 1) at the same time as the wolves and they are your priority targets. They channel nasty lightning attacks and confuse the hell out of the mechanics.
> 
> Now, lets break this up a bit. They will place a huge aoe on the floor (they channel then fire it) stay OUT of this big aoe. They will also cast lightning across the floor which you must avoid(just move your feet all the time so these don't catch you. And finally lightning bolts will come from the sky. These land very fast and the next shot is just as quick.
> 
> When this happens each player will have their own lightning bolts, so move around in a nice little circle (only a couple of feet or so) and keep moving so they always miss you until they are gone. DO NOT chase each other and do NOT stack. If you do so multiple players will put their OWN affects on top of other players, they will double up and die!
> 
> You MUST stay separate.
> 
> Above all the wardens must be focused before the boss is attacked again. During this time the tank needs to keep hold of any adds that come in and the boss and focus holding agro and NOT letting that dog go loose! Relax and focus on the mechanics together!

> ** ARCHIVIST ERNARDE **
> 
> The famous PUG killer boss himself, get ready, this really isn't as bad as it looks but you WILL have to focus on clean mechanics. The tank should hold agro on the boss at all times but the tank generally doesn't need to be NEAR the boss. Just keep him busy and focus on your key role in this fight. Explained below. The dps need to stand in a spread out semi circle around the boss and get ready to move their feet as and when they need to.
> 
> **ADDS!** - These are your MAIN priority! There are two adds to start with. Either one can turn into a hulking werewolf and they hurt like hell. The tank should take BOTH adds into the left or right corner of the room near the stairs and face them against the wall as soon as possible. This is where the group need to focus on killing them as fast as possible. If you have very high damage and/or use your ultimates you CAN sometimes kill them before they transform. However, the tank needs them in the corner. JUFFY (aka the hulking werewolf) takes NO prisoners and his mechanics need to be understood. The tank must block the stomp he does and the breath should never be spun on the group. If a stomp aoe is incoming the rest of the group MUST get the hell out of the way or die to a one shot.
> 
> So in short. focus these adds and ignore the boss damage wise (just be sure he is taunted). These adds will spawn again and again in the fight depending on the bosses health (so be sure to NOT over nuke the boss unless you can really handle it. Take your time, there is NO rush!
> 
> The adds will spawn at 76% 56% and 36%, a total of 4 waves of adds including the ones from the beginning. Take your time if you need to.
> 
> **Lightning** - The boss channel a heavy attack on one member of the group which will result in a spreading aoe. Once it hits its full size it will burst. The player with this aoe should move to one side and avoid overlapping on the group until it is gone else risk wiping out the team. Simply move, let it pop and come back in.
> 
> **Shield!** - This mechanic is where the boss will randomly pick one player and he will suspend them in the air with a shield over them. This shield must be broken with damage from your group to release your team member. If you do not kill it in time it will explode and the player will die.
> 
> **Rune Roulette!** - This mechanic is very simple once you KNOW it, pretty much like most things but at first glance is incredibly confusing. Don't worry it is not as bad as you mite think.
> 
> The boss will have a rotating sequence of runes changing above his head. He is deciding which one he wants. And you will see around the room there are 12 symbols with a circle under them.

> Here is where it gets simple but you have to act FAST...Once he settles on a choice, the symbol will stay solid. Every symbol around the room that is the SAME as his, will light up with an obvious circle of light under it, and of course the rune will be there to see.
> 
> When this happens you ALL need to go to 1 symbol each. There are 4 of each symbol in the room so be sure to get the right one. There are some to the left and right of the corridor, left and right of the stairs and at the TOP of the stairs (shown in the video, watch the tank).
> 
> If more than one person stands in the same room as someone else, the second person to arrive will die, GET YOUR OWN!!!
> 
> Also note during this phase the boss and the adds(if there are any) are all frozen on the spot, so you CAN still do damage and res people if required so long as you stay INSIDE the rune.
> 
> So in short...see which one he has chosen, go find your own that matches it...stand in it until the explosion goes off, and then carry on as normal. Failure will result in a one shot.
> 
> This mechanic is a lot simpler than it looks once you understand it, but this is crucial for hardmode on the last boss. So learn it ;)

> VYKOSA THE ASCENDANT
> 
> 
> ** VYKOSA THE ASCENDANT (AKA CAT-DOG) **
> 
> This boss is a pain in the rear end but hopefully this guide will help you. The danger in this fight is when people 'overburn' mechanics, stack up too much and/or don't co-ordinate together. You need to time your abilities and ultimates etc vs the mechanics. It's not a burn fest. The tank should hold the boss pretty much where she starts, and turn it away from the group. Do NOT drop the boss's taunt!
> 
> **Put it on a leash!** - There are two wolf pets in this fight, one red one and one grey one. They are attached to the wall via a dog lead/chain. The chain is a set length however and they SHARE it. So if the tank taunts both, they will only both reach the middle at most, but if you pull ONE, the other has a shorter leash. So the trick to this is to have the tank taunt one (the grey one) and then leave the red one alone for the group to focus. These both have the same mechanics so need to be paid attention too.
> 
> The dps should ALWAYS focus the red wolf on the left whenever it is active. Two things to note however. if the wolf tries to 'leap' you MUST dodge roll or take a one shot. Also if it tries to heavy attack you must dodge roll BACKWARDS. Do not stack else several will get caught by it but if you dodge different directions, it will follow you and spin and kill you and/or others anyway. Once the red wolf is dead, go meet the tank and kill the remaining wolf. They will cower into the corner for a duration and revisit the fight again later.
> 
> These are PRIORITY targets. Red one first, grey one second, do NOT leave these alive no matter what!
> 
> WARNING!: At 20% health of the boss, BOTH wolves will be OFF their leash, kill them asap!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will heavy attack the tank. This needs to be blocked else it is a one shot pretty much. If it is on a member of the group it must be dodge rolled or die, but this should ALWAYS be on the tank, unless your tank drops the taunt (which they should NOT).
> 
> **Bleed** - The tank will be hit with some NASTY bleeds from the boss so the healer MUST be on point at keeping up heals or you will wipe fast. Heavy heals are key!
> 
> **Fire** - This is pretty easy to spot. Vykosa will cause a small aoe fire blast to hit the ground. This is shown by her raising her staff in the air. Simply don't stand in it and wait for it to pass. Standing in it will go HIGH damage overtime to whoever is in it.
> 
> **Fear Totem** - The boss will place a medium sized circular aoe on the ground with a totem in the middle. This will FEAR players and to get out of it you MUST break free. Preserve your stamina and don't stand in the aoe! If this lands on the tank, they may want to reposition the boss to the left or the right so they don't stand in it on purpose for too long.
> 
> **Pounce** - Much like the middle boss of the dungeon she will pounce on the tank or whoever has agro. When this happens she MUST be interrupted else the person pinned will be chewed on and killed! PAY ATTENTION to interrupt mechanics at all costs!
> 
> **Stranglers** - You have seen these in the dungeon already, you should know how they work. However, at 70% the room is SURROUNDED by Stranglers. Keep dots near the tank at all times so that these die. They will get up again of course but they do have very low health and can be put into a 'sit down' state very easily. This will prevent unnecessary stunning. In the mean time as dps and healers, keep away form the edges of the room as much as you can and if you DO end up there. Keep your dots up to avoid the Stranglers overwhelming you.
> 
> **The PACK!** - This is an extremely important mechanic! At set health % the boss will spawn 2 adds and then shortly after another 2-3! These CAN and WILL overlap!
> 
> The werewolves you have seen throughout the entire dungeons...you know the ones that one shot you? THEY are coming in large numbers!.
> 
> 90% you will get 2x wolves
> 
> 85% you will get 3x!
> 
> 70% 2x wolves
> 
> 65% 2x wolves
> 
> 50% (see below for warden mechanic) 2x wolves
> 
> 46-45% 2x wolves
> 
> 30% 2x wolves
> 
> 25% 2x wolves
> 
> The trick to these is to focus and even save up your ultimates for these phases. You can literally slow down on the damage and build ultimate per phase. But remember they are were wolves so you WILL get ulti back for killing them with the fighters guild passives.
> 
> One more VERY important trick is CC. Your tank can pin them while taunting them (which btw is incredibly challenging with so many targets and so much damage incoming) BUT what you can do as a group is have plenty of 'time stop' abilities available as demonstrated in the video to control them.
> 
> These wolves take TOP priority! If they heavy attack leep you MUST dodgeroll as a dps or healer or die (also demonstrated in the video).
> 
> **Wardens** - This is an extremely tricky stage now. Not only do you have the mechanics you have had already but at 50% you get wardens in the fight. So to go with the werewolf pack you ALSO have to deal with these. Just like the middle boss in the dungeon, wardens are now PRIMARY!
> 
> This is where you want to change your positioning as the group. Instead of letting all the wolves come to the tank and throwing down ultimates and time stops (cc) you will want to run to the warden who spawns near the entrance and focus him down. They have the same mechanics as the previous fight containing wardens (lightning splashes, aoes on the ground and enrage type mechanics where they do mroe damage) so you should already be familiar with these. They MUST die, and yes even before the wolves! Get rid of them at all costs.
> 
> They spawn two at a time at set health check points. These spawn at 50%, 46/45%, 30% and 25% and a final 1x at about 21-20%. These MUST be focused at all times. Watch your feet and do NOT stack up.
> 
> **Archivist Ernarde!** - HE IS BACK!!
> 
> At 30% the ghost of the previous boss will enter the room with his mechanics in tact! He will cast his channeling heavy attack which makes a spreading aoe, just like in the last fight. Do not stack, move to a safe spot and wait for it to clear so you don't overlap it and kill your friends.
> 
> Above all, the 'Rune Roulette' is not IN THE ROOM! Every minute or so he will start choosing a rune. When he has chosen one, all 4 of you MUST fine ONE rune each matching his choice and stand in it or die!
> 
> TIP: be careful not to try and run near or through him (he is the purple guy in the middle of the room) he has a large hitbox and as shown in the video you can get stuck on him and end up dead by not making it to a rune in time.
> 
> Finally:
> 
> Remember all of these mechanics and put them into practice IN order and you will be fine but you will need to fully understand them.
> 
> Just relax and pay attention and work together as a team, yolo players will NOT get this done.
> 
> It is not a burn fest, you CAN pace this fight. Under 20% health once the wolves are all gone, wardens are dead and the two dogs are gone, the only thing you have left is the boss.
> 
> RELAX, execute panic kills people all the time, it isn't dead until it is dead. FOCUS mechanics and good luck!
