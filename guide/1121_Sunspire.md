### 洛克提兹

> LOKKESTIIZ


** 洛克提兹 ** 

这是Elder Scrolls Online游戏中的一个Boss名字。

冰龙！对于坦克来说这很简单，但团队必须保持专注并注意周围的情况。

主坦克可以选择近战或远程（远程推荐），但是必须确保龙的脸部面向远离团队的方向！

基本上，小组成员可以坐在右边，坦克可以坐在左边（或反过来），这样就不会出现不应该被咬的情况。

然而，将主坦克或副坦克置于房间后部是有意义的，这样他们就可以观察冰风何时到达（下面会解释）。当然，远程坦克不必被咬，可以躲起来反射/格挡远程攻击。这是个人喜好的问题，无论如何，把它从团队中转移，并保持一个坦克在后面，这样你就可以看到团队后面的东西何时出现，使得在瞬间把它叫出来更容易。

* **冰球攻击** :  如果你是远程攻击者，有时候甚至不是，你会被冰球攻击打中，这些攻击力相当强大，但可以通过特定技能来阻挡、反弹/吸收。一定要保持警惕，不要在没有防备的情况下被打中。

* **咬** :  如果靠近首领，他将用基础咬击攻击坦克，这些攻击非常强，通常可以一击即杀一个 dps 和/或治疗者，所以要小心。

* **流星** :  这个BOSS会在整个战斗中掉下流星或者地面AOE，尽量不要站在它们里面。如果被它们击中，你要么就会死亡，要么生命值会降低并需要挣脱束缚。它们会晕眩你！

* **冰息** :  首领会对目标所在的区域施放一个锥形冰息范围攻击（应该是坦克所在位置）。这是一个相当大的范围攻击，如果人们站在范围内，会非常快地死亡，因此请确保在将首领的面孔转向离开小组的方向时，保持专注。作为坦克，你应该阻挡此攻击，如果可能的话，甚至要叠加伤害盾，但请注意，这可能会稍稍破坏你的防守姿势，因此请勿在此过程中进行快速切换。

换栏技能会让你失去格挡，但这微小的干扰可能会延长恢复时间，重新应用格挡也许会太迟。所以如果你看到这个技能，保持格挡，直到它结束，不要做任何愚蠢的动作。

* **冰风** :  在战斗中，首领会向空中喷吐，并在房间后方生成一股冰之旋风。如果不能控制它，这将迅速摧毁整个小组。

翻译如下：队伍中的一名成员需要跑向该位置并站在那里。然后他们有8秒的时间来恢复到满血或者就会死亡！

如果你并没有注意龙的物理攻击，一个简单的方法是让一名坦克和一名治疗留在房间后方。将他们两个都指派去留意旋风。(请记住，这个坦克可能是从远程位置进行坦克操作的主要坦克)。

每次旋风出现时，大声告知团队并让治疗师集中治疗该玩家以保证其生存。

攻略翻译如下：

这还有一个主要问题。玩家一旦除掉了旋风，就会受到1分钟的debuff效果。并且这些风通常一个接一个地到来。你有足够的时间让3个独立的玩家在60秒内除掉这些风。所以....组织好你的团队，指定3个人分别为1、2、3号，并叫出他们的号码，他们就去除旋风。当没有点到他们的时候，他们就不去。

如果他们在受到debuff影响时靠近另一个旋风，他们会立即死亡。

* **新怪物出现** :  在80%、50%和20%的时候，BOSS会飞向空中，并刷新大量的怪物。这些怪物将会是冰霜元素和风暴元素的混合体。

你应该主要关注的是暴风元素，因为它们死后会在地上留下一个闪电圈。把冰元素拉到这些圈里，它们就会瞬间削减大量生命值，让你能够轻易地将它们击杀。

提示：让你的团队一起跑到房间的一侧，让坦克们尝试堆积小怪，将冰和风暴分开，以使没有正面横劈攻击会触及团队（除非你是坦克，请不要站在冰元素前面，否则你会死亡）。

顺便提醒队友们在这些阶段储存他们的终极技能。以尽可能高效的方式对风暴元素进行全方位压力攻击而不要蠢蠢地站在原地，在所有情况下要放松！像无头苍蝇一样乱跑会伤害队友。

一旦龙落地了，一定要继续击杀周围的其它小怪，否则你会被淹没。

你的主要关注点是小怪，但效率和集中是关键。你不需要大量的伤害来快速地击杀它们，但无论你有多少或没有多少伤害，所有的小怪都死光光将会在这一阶段结束时留下更多的小怪在房间里，使得房间里重新出现的巨龙变得更难管理。

* **闪电飞过** :  在上述阶段，boss会进行一次小型飞行，并直线吐出闪电穿过整个小组。避免被命中！它会留在地上几秒钟，所以不要故意站在它上面，但是如果你需要到房间的另一侧，你可以像白金塔的莫拉格·基纳机制一样闪避滚过去。

* **冰激光束** :  在上述阶段，Boss还会释放一束长长的冰激光束。它会贯穿整个房间，因此没有人可以避开它。这时你必须使用格挡！ 如果你不这样做，你就会死亡。 简单明了！

整个阶段结束后，首领将会重新降下来，然后你就可以像平常一样重复这个过程！

* **冰球** :  类似命运效果，首领将会瞄准一个玩家。该玩家将在脚下产生扩散的AOE效果，当其完全扩散之后，将在该玩家面前爆炸，直接击中该玩家。你需要做的就是与团队分开站立并格挡攻击。如果你堆在一起就会杀死队友，所以要小心！

* **困难模式** :  困难模式中会在以上机制的基础上增加或变化一些内容。

* **如果你充分理解了这场战斗的基本要素困难模式并不那么难然而如果你没有理解并经常随意尝试你会遇到很大的困难因此请注意以下内容** :  

1. Whirlwind – A heavy attack where the boss will spin around and hit anyone in melee range. Dodge roll to avoid it.

2. Lokkestiiz – The dragon boss that appears in the second round.

3. Nahviintaas – The dragon boss that appears in the third round.

4. Yolnahkriin – The final dragon boss.

5. Ri – The mini-boss that appears in the first round.

6. Cleave – A heavy attack that hits hard in a cone in front of the boss. Avoid standing in front of the boss.

7. Bash – An interrupt that stops the boss from casting abilities.

8. Bloodroot Forge – The dungeon where this fight takes place.

9. Clever – One of the add waves you will have to fight.

10. Unstable & Time Stop & Meteor – Mechanics you will have to deal with during the fight.

11. Guards – Adds that need to be killed before focusing on the boss.

在战斗中，会有成对的风暴/冰元素护卫。所以一定要在与龙战斗时集中攻击它们。

激光束阶段与以前一样，但是，当激光束结束时，每个玩家身上都会附有闪电AOE，随时间脉冲伤害。你们必须都分散开来找到一个位置，并且不要重叠，同时治疗师必须维持所有人的生命值。不要在房间里乱跑！

冰风不再只是针对三个人，你需要六个人。现在每个阶段会出现两股旋风！因此，第一组需要两个人，第二组需要两个人，第三组需要两个人。在开始战斗之前组织好，以维持集中精力和减少混乱。

在整个战斗中，你会看到火焰元素。你需要尽可能快地杀死它们。与火龙首领上的元素不同，这些元素如果需要，可以拖到队伍中杀死，但如果你可以远距离杀死它们，那么就这样做，以最高效的方式为你和团队提供帮助。





### 尤尔纳克林

> YOLNAHKRIIN


**尤尔纳克林**

这个Boss看起来相当吓人，效果非常夸张，但在我看来并不像冰雪Boss那样强。只要人们协调一致（就像游戏其他部分一样），并在团队中采取纪律，他们就会没问题。坦克应该靠近Boss，但不要太靠近以至于在Boss下面，而另一个坦克应该在房间的后面。

注意：后排防御者需要非常厚实。

攻略翻译如下：

整个小队，包括治疗队员，应该分成两个小组站在龙的脸的相反方向，和主坦克隔开。一个5人小组在左侧，另一个5人小组在右侧，当然要靠近对方，但仍然是两个不同的队列。其中，主坦克在龙的正面。

* **火山喷发爆炸** :  这就是两个叠层的主要原因。两名玩家会同时被一股火山喷发覆盖。队伍成员越多，伤害就会在他们之间分摊。它会发生5次，最后一次可以被格挡且伤害非常高。如果你的治疗师没有把握，或者你的队伍没有有效地叠加，那么人们很容易死亡。当然，叠加抗性cps和伤害护盾会有所帮助，但是最大的救星是叠加和格挡最后一次攻击。并非每个人都需要格挡最后一击，但为了安全起见，在熟悉队伍的生存度量标准时这样做没有坏处。

注意：如果玩家的站位不正确，个别玩家可能会受到恶劣的debuff，基本上下一秒钟就会被秒杀。你不希望这种情况发生。集中你的队形!

* **冲刺并吞噬** :  龙会向仇恨目标喷出一个巨大的火焰锥形攻击。坦克应该站在最前面接受攻击。在此期间，要确保格挡攻击，并保持任何你可以管理的抗性和/或伤害护盾。我个人觉得冰属性攻击更强，但这个技能也相当厉害。此外，一定不要贴在龙的鼻子上坦克，因为如果距离太近，龙也会推开你。他喜欢你在嘲讽范围内，但不想和你贴得太近。

* **火球撕咬** :  当然，作为一只火龙，它会向坦克喷火，还会咬坦克。特别是它的重击攻击非常危险，但只要保持资源和阻挡它，你应该没问题。再次记住，不要离它太近，因为它会用力将你推开，让你失去阻挡。

* **火灵** :  切勿将它们带进小组内。虽然有些战术需要它们的存在，但为了安全起见练习时和通常情况下99%的情况下，请勿将它们引入房间。

每当后排的坦克发现了一个火焰元素，他们应该将它靠近自己并让团队知道其位置。团队在保持自己的阵列的情况下，应该翻转180度，停止攻击龙，全力集中击杀火焰元素。

当它们死亡时，它们会在地上留下巨大的熔岩池，就像血根熔炉的最后一关BOSS。站在里面会让你死亡。这就是为什么你不想让它加入小组。它会妨碍大家，给人们带来死亡威胁，近战类型无法接近龙。

* **攻略翻译如下

铁制自走炮** :  坦克测试！** - 在战斗期间，将会出现铁制自走炮。这些需要被后排坦克控制和拦截。在战斗中，如果需要更长时间将龙推至飞行阶段，这些自走炮会更多地生成。有些坦克可以控制2个，有些可以控制4个！但这取决于你的小组。最重要的关键点是这些自走炮不是用来杀死的，而是用来控制的。

他们只有一种需要格挡的重型攻击。如果不注意时间，它们的多重攻击可以杀死坦克。基本上，如果你可以长时间地坦住难度模式下血根熔炉的执行阶段而不杀死它们且仍然存活，你就可以做到这一点！

尽管在这场战斗中没有真正的“DPS检查”，但作为背部坦克，保持生存至关重要，并且集中火力围攻龙（除非出现火焰元素），以确保尽可能少地遭受攻击。

* **火焰核爆阶段** : 当首领的生命值分别剩余75％，50％和25％时，它会飞到空中并在上方聚集一道巨大的火焰吐息。整个团队需要赶快到区域边缘以避免受到伤害！同时，如果还有火焰魔像存活的话就优先击杀它们，然后开始攻击铁魔像。坦克应该将它们集中在房间的边缘。

一旦巨龙的火息声音完全停止了（他好像嚷着“ poop NAH！”，如果不好笑就别笑了，哈哈），铁制防御塔将会变得炽热！当它们处于这种状态时，它们比通常受到更多伤害，并且可以极快地被击杀，但前提是你必须会集中火力。

此时龙又要着陆了，大家需要快速回到位置准备喷泉的喷发，但当然熔融铁震元素是你的主要攻击目标！

* **高级技巧由于它们受到了大量额外的倍增伤害任何溅射伤害被动技能都会攻击多个目标这意味着如果你正在攻击一个目标另一个目标将受到同等的伤害使得群攻击败非常迅速这可能超过500k** : 1mill dps，仅仅在那个小阶段内...所以，如果你有一个协调良好的聪明小组，并且你可以在危险的“将阿托斯堆叠在老板身上”的时候偷偷摸摸地操作，他们的任何溅射伤害都会对老板造成疯狂的伤害。

这可能只是五秒钟左右的伤害，但每秒100万的伤害，也许在五秒钟内，仍然是500万的伤害，现在你不必再烦恼它，可以更快地进入下一阶段。

* **从这里开始战斗就是洗礼重复直到执行阶段基本上你只需要杀死它然而机制仍然存在你必须管理好你的队形你必须击败火焰元素作为后排坦克你必须专注于让铁质元素远离队伍此外还有以下专有名词** :  Whirlwind => 旋风 
- Lokkestiiz => Lokkestiiz 
- Dragon => 龙 
- Nahviintaas => 纳温塔丝 
- Yolnahkriin => 尤尔纳克林 
- Ri => 里 
- Cleave => 横劈 
- Bash => 巴什 
- Bloodroot Forge => 血根熔炉 
- Clever => 聪慧者 
- Lokkestiiz => 洛克提兹 
- Un => 乌恩 
- Time Stop => 时间静止 
- Meteor => 流星 
- Guard => 守卫

记住，低输出也许可以胜任，但你将会越来越多地遭遇震荡者，这会对坦克造成压力。你越快击败它就越好，但是如果你有一个经验丰富的坦克，那么你会有更多的时间放松并继续做你正在做的事情来对抗这种情况。注意平衡。

* **攻略翻译如下

困难模式** :  除了血量更高之外，困难模式还有一些小区别。要记住，由于血量更高，意味着推到每个boss血量阶段的时间会更长，这意味着你可能会有更多atronachs要处理。所以要小心，集中精力！重生游戏，以泪洗面。其中Whirlwind翻译为旋风，Lokkestiiz翻译为洛克提兹，Dragon翻译为龙，Nahviintaas翻译为纳温塔丝，Yolnahkriin翻译为尤尔纳克林，Ri翻译为里，Cleave翻译为横劈，Bash翻译为巴什，Bloodroot Forge翻译为血根熔炉，Clever翻译为聪慧者，Lokkestiiz翻译为洛克提兹，Un翻译为乌恩，Time Stop翻译为时间静止，Meteor翻译为流星，Guard翻译为守卫。

火焰元素必须快速击杀。以前只需要确保你击杀了它们，否则你就会被压倒，但现在如果你不能在规定时间内将它们击杀，它们就会愤怒并发出蓝色光芒（就像白金塔中的平面抑制装置）。当这种情况发生时，它们会冲向团队并爆炸。快速击杀它们！

时间静止的效果会在针对玩家的龙附近的小组内发生。这是为了使你失去平衡。你必须走出这些区域，否则就会被眩晕。虽然你可以简单地挣脱控制，但问题在于，如果治疗师被眩晕了，没有人能够幸存陨石喷发。因此，你必须迅速走出去，然后再回来，这样你就准备好了，可以像2个小组一样堆叠在一起。你可以让其他人留在里面，只让治疗师出去，但这取决于你和你的小组。

然而，不断地解除控制效果会对资源产生干扰，除非你和团队一起装备以获得大量的资源增益，否则可能会很棘手。

尽量不要让这个过程变得太复杂。它会使人晕眩，以适合你和你的团队的方式处理它，不要四处惊慌。没有必要这样。





### 纳温塔丝

> NAHVIINTAAS


**纳温塔丝**

就像其他首领一样，这个首领也有非常基本的机制需要跟随，反复练习。我的意思是，一旦你掌握了一个阶段，你就可以掌握其他阶段，它们并没有真正发生太多变化。

然而，保持团队机制的一致性，不要无缘无故地改变计划是困难的。重复和专注是关键！另外，注意翻译错误： Lokkestiiz是Lokkestiiz，Nahviintaas是纳维因塔斯，Yolnahkriin是约尔纳克林。

这个首领的坦克方式与其他首领相似。主坦克站在龙的一侧，副坦克需要注意额外机制，并准备在事情出错时接替坦克。团队应该聚集在龙头的另一侧。

保持嘲讽，除非您已死亡或被标记（下面有解释），否则不要放弃它。

首先，你会看到一个房间里充满了附加怪物，你必须处理这些怪物。与试炼的其余部分一样，必须尽快专注地解决“命运”（Fate） boss。剩余的怪物必须由坦克控制，同时小组留在坦克的身后。这需要练习，因为有很多事情要处理，但记住不要惊慌。你有足够的时间。一旦小怪都死了，你就会进入第一个火焰阶段，了解你需要了解的关于剩下的战斗。这个阶段会一遍又一遍地重复。

* **隐藏攻击阶段** :  打倒小怪后，Boss将开始向房间中央喷火。团队应该靠近一座雕像，但也保持散开。多个火焰将会瞄准多个玩家，你不希望它们重叠。

这个BOSS会在房间的中心造成三次大范围火焰爆炸。最后一次爆炸将会覆盖整个房间，当这一次发生时，团队必须全员叠在一起躲在一个雕像后面以躲避。

在此阶段，会有烈焰元素，必须尽快击杀。最后的一波将会出现三个烈焰元素！把它们拉进来，干掉它们，准备好和龙降落开始战斗。

在清理掉小兵之后，每次龙起飞时都会出现这个阶段。

当龙到达80％，60％和40％时飞起来时，通过远离龙腾飞的位置为坦克腾出空间以抓住小怪物！要准备好面对小怪物的出现！

* **湖镇** :  当小怪阶段时，纳维将在整个区域飞行，喷出炙热的火焰形成类似于《霍比特人》中斯矛格对湖镇的攻击的巨大直线。不要站在里面！

* **咬** :  Boss将咬住坦克，造成严重伤害，需要格挡！

* **火息之吐息** :  首领会对坦克喷出一股火息之吐息，应该尽量格挡！

* **团队之息** :  是一个整个小队都要应对的吐息机制！这很简单，龙会连续吐息从一侧到另一侧。你只需要使用格挡就可以安全度过。如果不使用格挡，你就会死亡。

* **头槌颈部摆动** :  BOSS会砸地并抬起头。他这样做时，就会对整个小队发起一个180度的巨大颈部摆动头槌。 要么格挡，要么被击退并有可能被击杀。很简单。

注意：如果你距离目标很远，攻击不会命中。对于远程组很有帮助。

* **火焰象形** :  与火焰BOSS不同，这些象形可以被拖到团队中，应该这样做。这些必须快速击败，因为它们会爆炸并杀死人。确保一旦它们死亡，不要站在它们的AOE范围内，并确保快速杀死它们，优先考虑这样做，以免炸掉所有人。如果一个火焰象形仍然活着，那么你做错了些什么。

* **时间静止** :  这些会使玩家眩晕，所以你需要避开它们。但在传送门阶段（下文解释）时，你需要有一个人故意站在它们里面，因为这样会向团队的传送门传递非常需要的增益！另外，建议团队中的**聪慧者**或其他有突进能力的角色负责快速跳过它们，以防耽误战斗进度。在这一阶段，
需要特别留意几个**重击**技能，包括**旋风、横劈、巴什**等，它们可以显著削弱传送门的护盾。在之后的两个阶段，注意掌握好各类**龙**的特性和弱点。其中，**洛克提兹、里、纳温塔丝、尤尔纳克林、乌恩**都是必须要重点注意的龙。最后，进入**血根熔炉**需要考虑好组员之间的配合和技能选择，充分利用团队的输出和控制能力，才能成功完成挑战。

* **传送门永恒仆从** :  在进入飞行阶段之前，即在血量剩下10%时，也就是在血量剩下90%, 70%, 和50%的时候，房间后面会出现3个传送门。需要3个人进入这些传送门中。

在里面将会有一个拥有大约360万生命值的永恒仆人。三个DPS玩家需要在同时生存并与机制作战的情况下同时杀死它！

该仆从将施放许多技能。

必须避开闪电飞溅，所以移动你的脚并且不要堆在一起！

巨大的闪电范围会覆盖在地面上，不要站在范围内，因为它会造成很大的伤害并且削弱你的魔法能力！

一个锥形范围的AOE将瞄准团队中的一个成员，他们需要保持位置并格挡它（也可以通过非常特定的时机躲避它）。最重要的是，没有人应该跑进它，玩家也不应该四处奔波，你不希望击中其他人（就像VAS中的毒素一样）。其中Whirlwind为技能名，Lokkestiiz为龙名，Dragon为专有名词，Nahviintaas为龙名，Yolnahkriin为龙名，Ri为技能名，Cleave为技能名，Bash为技能名，Bloodroot Forge为地名，Clever为人名，Un为专有名词，Time Stop为技能名，Meteor为技能名，Guard为技能名。

一个大爆炸的aoe技能会影响一个玩家，然后爆炸，你应该把它带到老板附近，让它在老板旁边爆炸，这样像命运能力一样的流星就会落到老板身上，将旋风投掷在他身上。其中，Whirlwind（旋风）是一个技能名称，Lokkestiiz（洛克提兹）是一个专有名词，Meteor（流星）也是一个技能名称。

当boss在祷告时，你必须打断他，否则你们所有人都会被击退并眩晕！

玩家会被单独按在地上，就像在圣所奥菲迪亚与奥扎拉战斗时一样。其他玩家需要跑过去激活协同技能来释放他们！其中"Sanctum Ophidia"为专有名词，暂未提供翻译。

最后，如果有人站在楼上的时间静止区域，你将会在楼下看到一个小小的绿色圆圈！拾取它，它会在短时间内增加你的伤害并且让战斗变得容易很多！

注：在楼下，你有90秒的时间杀死仆人。如果你失败了，他会进入楼上的战斗，完全无敌并且杀死整个队伍。

* **在90秒内与3个拥有3536百万血量的人战斗这意味着您需要确保每个玩家都能够遵循机制并且输出约126** : 13.3k的DPS（有些会波动，因此需要考虑执行力等因素）。以上是成功击杀所需的最低要求。因此有DPS检查，但只要您遵循这些机制并且没有死亡或灭团，要求的DPS检查非常低。

* **治疗或死亡** :  玩家可能会面临一种负面效果，在他们的状态栏上可能会出现伤害护盾的图标，但是他们的健康值会很低。基本上，他们必须通过治疗来填满状态栏，否则就会死亡。这就像在Moongrave Fane中hoavar机制一样。

* **被标记死亡** :  Boss会用一种喷溅类型的攻击打击坦克，将它标记为死亡，会有一个debuff来显示这一点。如果玩家在这种状态下被再次打中，他们将会死亡。因此，这个技巧很简单。每次有人被标记死亡时交换坦克，一切都会没事，因为debuff的计时器会在不需要被击败的情况下消失...... 或者如果你非常有经验的坦克，你可以躲闪它，完全避免被打中。但这需要一些练习。

在普通难度下，你实际上可以存活下来，但是在老练难度下，除非你闪避滚动/交替坦克，否则你无法生存。 

建议使用以下技能和装备： 

技能：Whirlwind（旋风）、Lokkestiiz（洛克提兹）、Dragon（龙）、Nahviintaas（纳温塔丝）、Yolnahkriin（尤尔纳克林）、Ri（里）、Cleave（横劈）、Bash（巴什）、Time Stop（时间静止）、Meteor（流星）。 

装备：Bloodroot Forge（血根熔炉）、Clever（聪慧者）、Lokkestiiz（洛克提兹）、Un（乌恩），以及其他适合你的装备。 

对于Guard（守卫），最好有一个坚实的团队一起作战。

* **处决** :  在31%以下的时候，龙会向空中喊叫，屏幕会略微改变颜色，并开始以3人为目标！基本上，你要紧密并非主攻击，同时遵循基本原则，但是如果你被AOE攻击锁定，你必须跑到房间的侧面/后面并将其放在地上，否则你会有麻烦。如果它在你所在的团队中掉落，人们无法站在上面，但是如果你将其放在侧面并回来，那就没问题了。

* **困难模式** :  困难模式中的主要区别并不多，但已经有很多要处理了，所以增加更多要注意，但这些变化很重要！

雕像会活过来！必须击杀它们，比较容易控制它们的位置，在龙的周围远离侧边或后方。这样大部分攻击都会落空，除了龙的火息攻击。这些雕像有非常特定的机制。

直到他们开始施法之前，他们对所有伤害都免疫。当他们开始施法时，每秒钟对整个团队会造成越来越多的伤害。这是你造成伤害的机会。如果你想停止施法，打断并且它会再次免疫很长一段时间。反复执行此操作。 

其中出现的专有名词翻译如下：
Whirlwind=>旋风
Lokkestiiz=>洛克提兹
Dragon=>龙
Nahviintaas=>纳温塔丝
Yolnahkriin=>尤尔纳克林
Ri=>里
Cleave=>横劈
Bash=>巴什 
Bloodroot Forge=>血根熔炉  
Clever=>聪慧者
Un=>乌恩
Time Stop=>时间静止
Meteor=>流星
Guard=>守卫

问题在于，如果有人在完成巴什技能或使用会打断的技能，你永远都不会杀死它。因此，请确保没有人使用破甲冲击或任何基于打断的技能。只有当整个团队同意并且不仅仅是因为房间上有红色闪光时才打断。一旦它死了，它就会离开房间，你就不能再躲在它后面了（请注意，你有足够的地方可以在整个战斗中躲藏）。

根据下层传送门的玩家，你完全可以跳过整个阶段，但这不是我们要讨论的重点。了解你的机制。

楼下的传送门有个变化。关于机制的一切都完全相同, 但是...仆从的生命值现在是1,130万！

意思是每个玩家下去必须能够输出41.8k的DPS，并同时保持机械结构。是的，当然，一个人可以有50，另一个人可以有30，但基本上楼下需要三个人之间的125k的DPS。因此，可以按照您喜欢的方式分配，但这是要求的。

* **所以你不需要每个人都有90k** : 100k的输出！这将是270-300k的总输出，而你甚至不需要其一半来完成 #事实！

这场战斗有一个DPS检查，但在目前的游戏状态下，每个人的DPS都达到42K并不难，特别是如果你已经到达了这个首领所在的位置！

了解机制，不要失败基础，即使是不懂得CP的玩家也可以达到这些数字。不要因为无意义的跟木桶练习而惊慌。专注于发挥自己的长处，不要死亡！

在执行时，地上的流星不会消失，你需要非常好地利用你的空间，特别是如果团队的DPS较低。它仍然100%可行，但一定要确保尽可能多地使用房间。

当传送门出现时，你将会在楼上面对两个普通的小兵。你可以把它们放在Boss身边一起打，或者将它们拉到一边，让龙自己面对Boss，之后再回来处理它们。其中一个小兵会放锋风斩，需要小心躲避；另一个小兵则只会普攻。在这里，你可以使用普通技能来击败这些小兵。总之，处理好这两个小兵是接下来打Boss的必要准备。在处理完这两个小兵之后，Boss会进入下一个阶段，届时你需要跟随BOSS的位置移到正确的范围内继续对付Boss。

> The ICE dragon! This is pretty straight forward for the tanks but the group must maintain focus and awareness of what is going on around them.
> 
> The main tank can chose to either tank close or far (ranged taught) but they must make sure the FACE of the dragon is aimed away from the group!
> 
> Basically the group can sit to the right and the tank can sit to the left (or vica versa) that way no one gets bitten when they shouldn't
> 
> The reason it makes sense however to have main or off tank at the back of the room is so that they can  spot when the ice winds arrive (explained below). Not to mention of course a ranged tank doesn't have to get bitten so can hide away and reflect/block ranged attacks instead. It is a matter of preference but either way, turn it from the group, and keep ONE of your tanks at the back so you can see when the stuff behind the group appears, making it easier to call it out in the heat of the moment.
> 
> **Ice spit** - If you are ranged and sometimes even if you are not, you will be hit with ice ball attacks, these hit pretty hard but can be blocked and/or reflected/absorbed with specific skills. Be sure to not get hit with this with your guard down.
> 
> **Bite** - If close to the boss he will hit the tank with basic bite attacks, which are pretty hard hitting and can generally one shot a dps and/or healer so be careful.
> 
> **Meteors** - The boss will drop meteors and/or ground based aoes through the fight, try not to stand in them. If you get caught you will either die OR be low health and have to break free. They do stun!
> 
> **Ice Breath** - The boss will cast an ice breath cone aoe at the person with aggro at the time (should be the tank). This is a rather large cone aoe that will kill people VERY fast if they stand in it, so be sure to maintain your focus when aiming the boss's face away from the group so no one gets caught out! You should block this as the tank and even stack damage shields if possible but be warned this can nudge you a little so don't bar swap while doing this.
> 
> Bar swapping drops your block anyway however that little nudge will add extra milliseconds to you recovering from the dropped block and reapplying it maybe too late. So if you see it, hold block and don't do anything stupid until it is over.
> 
> **Icey Winds** - During the fight the boss will spit into the air and spawn a whirl wind of ice at the back of the room. This will DEVASTATE the entire group rapidly if not controlled.
> 
> The way to do this is, a member of the group must run to it and stand in it. They then have 8 seconds to be healed to full health or DIE!
> 
> One easy way to stay on top of this especially if you are not paying attention to the dragon's physical actions...Is to have one tank and one healer at the back of the room. Assign them BOTH to keep an eye on the winds while they are there. (remember this could be the main tank, tanking from range).
> 
> Whenever a wind spawns, shout it out and then the healer can focus that player to save them.
> 
> There is one more major issue with this. Once a player has removed the wind, they are debuffed for a minute. And these winds tend to come one after the other. You have enough time for 3 individual players to get rid of the winds before 60seconds is over. SO...Set your group up and assign 3 people to be number 1, 2 and 3. Whenever their number is called out, they go get the wind. When it is NOT, they don't.
> 
> If they take a wind too close to another (while debuffed) they will die instantly.
> 
> **Adds!!** - At 80% 50% and 20% the boss will fly off into the air and spawn a massive amount of adds. There will be a mixture of Ice Atronachs and Storm Atronachs.
> 
> Your key primary focus should be on the Storm Atronachs. Once they die they will drop a lightning circle on the ground. Drag the Ice Atronachs into these and they will POP down to TINY amounts of health allowing you to finish them off.
> 
> TIPS: Make your group all together run to one side of the room and let the tanks try to stack up the adds, separating the ICE from the Storm so that no frontal cleave attacks will touch the group (don't stand in front of the ice atros unless you are a tank, you will die).
> 
> Make the group save their ultimate's for these phases by the way. Put full pressure on the Storm Atronach's as efficiently as possible without standing in stupid and above all RELAX! Running around like headless chickens will kill people.
> 
> Once the dragon finally comes down, be sure to continue with any remaining adds else you will get overwhelmed.
> 
> Adds are your primary focus, but efficiency and focus is key. You don't need a HUGE amount of damage to kill them fast, but no matter how much you do or don't have, everyone being dead will leave you with more adds in the room at the end of the phase making it more difficult to manage with the dragon back in the room.
> 
> **Lightning fly by!** - During the above phase the boss will do a little fly by and breath lightning in a straight line right through the group. Avoid getting hit by this! It will remain on the floor for a few seconds so don't stand in it on purpose, although if you need to get to the other side of the room, you CAN dodge roll through it, much like Molag Kena's mechanic in White Gold Tower.

> **Ice laser beam** - During the above phase also, the boss will cast a LONG ice beam. It will cut across the WHOLE room so NO ONE can avoid it. When this happens you MUST simply BLOCK! If you don't you will die. Simple!
> 
> Once the whole phase is over, the boss will come back down and you rinse repeat as normal!
> 
> **Ice ball** - Much like the effects from the Fates, the boss will target one player. They will have a spreading aoe effect under their feet and when it reaches full it will explode and hit them in the face. All you need to do is separate yourself from the group and block it. If you stack up you will kill people so be careful!
> 
> **HARDMODE** - There are some additions/variations to the above mechanics for hard mode.
> 
> IF you fully understand the basics of this fight, hardmode is not that difficult. If you do not however and generally wing it, you will struggle badly. So be aware of the following:-
> 
> There will be Storm/Ice Atronachs in pairs throughout the fight. So be sure to focus them even while fighting the dragon.
> 
> The laser beam phase is the same BUT, when the beam is over each player will have a lightning AOE attached to them pulsing damage over time. You must ALL spread out and find a space and NOT overlap these, in the mean time the healers must keep everyone alive. Don't run around the room!
> 
> The ice winds are no longer for 3 people. You need 6 people. Instead of there being one wind per phase there are TWO! So group 1 is 2 people, group 2 is 2 people, and group 3 is 2 people. Organize that before you start the fight in order to maintain focus and less chaos
> 
> Throughout the fight you will see Flame Atronachs. You need to kill these as fast as possible. Unlike those on the Fire Dragon boss, these CAN be brought into the group and killed if you like, but if you can kill them at range then so be it, whichever is more efficient for you and the group.

> This boss is pretty scary to look at and very dramatic with it's effects but is in my opinion not as rough as the ice boss. So long as people co-ordinate (much the same as the rest of the game really) and apply discipline withing their formations in the group, they will be fine. The tank should stay close to the boss but NOT so close that they are UNDER him, and the other tank should be at the BACK of the room.
> 
> NOTE: The back tank needs to be REALLY chunky.
> 
> The rest of the group including the healers should be on the opposite side of the dragon's face to the main tank in TWO small groups stacking on each other. One group of 5 on the left and one group of 5 on the right, CLOSE to each other of course, but yet still two different stacks.
> 
> **Fire Geyser/Explosion** - This is the main reason for the two stacks. two players at once will get a fire geyser under them. The more people in their stack the more damage is shared between the group members. It will tick 5x and the last tick CAN be blocked and hits very hard. If your healers are not on point, or your group is not stacked effectively then people will die to this a lot. Stacking resistance cps and damage shields of course will help but stacking and blocking the last tick above all is the biggest saver. Not everyone will need to block the last hit but for safety sake, it doesn't hurt to do so while you are getting used to your group's gauge for survival.
> 
> NOTE: If people are not stacked properly individual players can get a nasty debuff which basically one shots then on the next tick. You don't want this to happen. Focus your formation!
> 
> **Charge and devour** - The dragon will breath fire in a massive cone at the person with aggro. This should be the TANK! When this happens be sure to block it and maintain any resistance and/or damage shields you can manage. The ice one i personally feel hits harder but this can still be pretty nasty. Also be sure to NOT tank right up the dragon's nose because this also has a push back if you are too close, he likes you to be within range of taunt but not in his personal space so to speak!
> 
> **Fireball/Bite** - Of course with this being a fire dragon he will spit fire at the tank AND he will bite the tank too. It's pretty nasty especially the heavy attack but just be sure to maintain resources and block it and you should be fine. Remember again, don't stay too close to him because he will nudge you and drop your block.
> 
> **Fire Atronachs** - DO NOT!! Bring these into the group. There are tactics out there that can make use of having these close but when you are practicing and/or just 99% of the time anyway for safety sake, do NOT bring these into the room.
> 
> Whenever the tank at the back spots a Flame Atronach, they should pull them close to them and let the group know it is there. The group while staying IN their stacks should then flip 180 degrees, STOP hitting the dragon and FULLY focus on killing the Flame Atronach.
> 
> When these die they drop huge pools of lava on the floor much like the last boss in Bloodroot Forge. Standing in it will kill you. This is why you DON'T want that IN the group. It iwll get in the way, kill people, and melee types won't reach the dragon.
> 
> **Iron Atronachs aka Tank Test!** - During the fight Iron Atronachs will spawn. These need to be controlled and HELD by the back tank. During the fight the longer it takes to push the dragon to his flying phase, the more of these will spawn. Some tanks can manage 2, some can manage 4! But depends on your group. The key point above all is these are not for killing, they are for controlling.
> 
> They have ONE major heavy attack which needs to be blocked. Multiples of them can kill tanks if not paying attention so timing is everything. Basically if you can tank the execute phase of hardmode bloodroot forge for a LONG time without killing them and still be alive, you can do this!
> 
> While there aren't any real 'dps checks' in this fight, it is important that you maintain survival as the back tank and just focus on the dragon as a group (unless flame atros come out) to make sure that you get as phew of these as possible.
> 
> **Fire NUKE phase** - At 75%, 50% and 25% the boss will fly into the air and will channel above the area with a MASSIVE fire breath. The whole group needs to get to the edge of the area in order to avoid this! In the mean time, kill any remaining flame atronachs if there are any and then start hitting the Iron Atronachs. The tank should pull these all together to the very edge of the room.
> 
> Once the HUGE dragon breath has finished (he sounds like he shouts 'poop NAH!' don't laugh if it ain't funny lol) the Iron Atronachs will be MOLTEN! When they are like this, they take an insane amount more damage than usual and can be killed extremely fast IF you focus.
> 
> At this point the dragon will be landing again so people need to get back into position fast ready for the Gysers but of course the molten Iron Atronachs are your key focus!
> 
> ADVANCED TIP: Since they take a LOT of extra multiplied damage, ANY splash damage passives hit multiple targets. Meaning if you are heavy attacking ONE target, the other will be hit for equal damage, making for very fast aoe kills. This can be in excess of 500k-1mill dps just during that small phase...SO, if you are a well co-ordinated clever group and you can be sneaky about a risky 'stack the atros on the boss' while they are molten, ANY splash damage from THEM will hit the boss a crazy amount.
> 
> This could be only 5 seconds or so of damage, but 1million damage per second perhaps over 5 seconds, is still 5 million damage you now don't have to mess about with and can get to the next phase faster.
> 
> From here the fight is rinse repeat until execute when basically you just have to KILL IT! However, mechanics are still in place...You must manage your formation, you must kill the Flame Atronachs, and you MUST focus as the back tank on keeping the Iron Atronachs off the group.
> 
> Remember while low dps can be fine and succeed, you WILL get more and more atronachs which CAN put pressure on the tank. The fast you kill it the better but then also to counter that, if you have a BIG experienced beefy tank, then you have more time to relax and keep doing what you are doing.
> 
> **HARDMODE** - There are some small differences to hardmode apart from the much higher health. Bare in mind with the higher health that does mean it will take longer to push to each phase of the boss's health meaning you are likely to have more atronachs to deal with the in room. So be careful focus! Rez games, end in tears.
> 
> Flame Atronachs MUST be killed fast. Before you just had to make sure you kill them or you get overwhelmed, NOW if you don't kill them in due time they will enrage and glow BLUE (like the Planar Inhibitor in White Gold Tower). When this happens they will charge at the group and explode. Kill them fast!
> 
> Time Stop effects will happen inside the group near the dragon aimed at players. This is to throw you off. You will have to step OUT of these or be stunned. While you can simply break free the issue is if the healers get stunned no one will survive the Geysers. So you must get out quickly and get back in again so you are ready to stay stacked as your 2 groups. You can make other's stay in it and just make the healers get out but that is up to you and your group.
> 
> However, constantly breaking free will mess with resources unless you are equipped as a group for huge resource gains, so can be tricky.
> 
> Try not to make this one too complex. It stuns, deal with it in a way that suits you and your group where they DON'T run around panicking. There is no need.
>

> 
> ** NAHVIINTAAS **
> 
> Much like the other bosses this one has very copy and paste rinse repeat mechanics. What i mean by that is, once you can do ONE phase, you can do the rest, they don't REALLY change all that much.
> 
> However, maintaining consistency within your group mechanics wise and people not trying to change things up for no reason is where it gets tricky. Repetition and focus is key!
> 
> This boss should be tanked pretty much the same as the rest. Main tank to one side, Off tank being aware of extra mechanics and ready to pick up where things go wrong, and the group should be stacked together on the OTHER side of the dragon's head.
> 
> Maintain a taunt, don't drop it unless you are dead or marked (Explained below).
> 
> To start with you will have a room full of adds you must deal with. As per the rest of the trial, the Fate MUST be dealt with as fast as possible and focused. The rest must be controlled by the tank while the group stays BEHIND them. It will take practice as there is a lot gong on but remember not to panic. You have plenty of time. Once the adds are dead you will have the first Fire phase teaching you what you need to know about the rest of the fight. This phase does get repeated throughout.
> 
> **Hide/Fire Phase** - Once the adds are down the boss will start spitting fire into the middle of the room. The group should go CLOSE to a statue but also remain spread out. Multiple pops of fire will aim for multiple players and you don't want those to overlap.
> 
> The boss will cause 3 major bursts of fire aoe in the MIDDLE of the room. The final one will be the size of the whole room and when THIS one happens, the group must all stack and hide together behind a statue to avoid it.
> 
> During this phase there will be flame atronachs and they MUST be killed as soon as possible. The final pop will spawn 3 of them! Pull them in, take them down, and be ready for the dragon to land and start the fight.
> 
> This phase will happen every time the dragon goes into the air AFTER the adds are dealt with.
> 
> Be ready for the adds by moving away from the dragon making room for the tanks to grab them when the dragon flies at 80%, 60% and 40%!
> 
> **LAKE TOWN!** - During the add phases Navi will fly across the area breathing fire in a HUGE straight line resembling the Lake Town attack from Smaug in The Hobbit. Don't STAND in it!
> 
> **Bite** - The boss will bite the tank causing heavy damage, this must be blocked!
> 
> **Breath** - The boss will aim a fire breath at the tank which can and should be blocked!
> 
> **Group Breath!** - Yup a breath mechanic for the WHOLE group! This is simple, the dragon will breathe from one side to the next in a constant channel. All you have to do is BLOCK and you will be fine. If you don't you will die.
> 
> **Headbutt/Neck swing** - The boss will punch the ground and raise his head in the air. When he does this, a BIG 180degree Neck swinging headbutt is coming for the group. BLOCK it or be knocked back and possibly killed. Pretty simple.
> 
> NOTE: IF you are very far away, you will not be hit because it will not reach. Handy to know for RANGED groups.
> 
> **Flame Atronachs** - Unlike the fire boss, these CAN be dragged into the group and should be. These need to be killed fast because they EXPLODE and kill people. Be sure to not stand in their aoe once they die and also be sure to kill them fast and prioritize the so they don't nuke everyone. If a Flame Atronach is still alive you are doing something wrong.
> 
> **Timestop** - These will stun players, so you want to avoid them HOWEVER you will want one person occasionally do deliberately stand in them when the Portal phase is happening (explained below) because THIS will actually send a much needed buff  into the portal for the group!
> 
> **Portals/Eternal Servant** - At 10% health before the flying phases, so at 90%. 70% and 50% there will be 3 portals appearing at the back of the room. 3 people need to take these and go IN.
> 
> Inside there will be an eternal servant who has around 3.6mil health. The 3 dps players need to KILL this at the same time as surviving and fighting with the mechanics!
> 
> The Servant will cast many abilities.
> 
> Lightning splashes must be avoided so move rout feet and do NOT stack!
> 
> BIG lighting aoe circle will be on the ground also, don't stand in it because it will hurt a lot AND negate your magicka abilities!
> 
> A Cone based AOE will be aimed at ONE member of the group, they need to maintain their position and block this (also dodgeable with very specific timing). Above all no one should run in this and the player should not be running around either, you don't want to hit other people with it (much like the poison in VAS).
> 
> A large bursting aoe will affect one player and then explode, you should take this TO the boss and let it pop nice and close so the meteor (like the fate's abilities) lands ON the boss dropping the whirlwind on him.
> 
> When the boss is praying you MUST interrupt him else you will all get knock backed and stunned!
> 
> Players individually will be pinned to the ground, much like the fight with Ozara in Sanctum Ophidia. These players must be helped by running over and activating a synergy to release them!
> 
> Finally, if someone stands in time stop UPSTAIRS, you will get a small green circle DOWNSTAIRS! Pick this up, it will increase your damage for a short period of time and make the fight a LOT easier!
> 
> NOTE: While downstairs you have 90 seconds to kill the servant. If you fail he will enter the fight upstairs, completely immortal and kill the group.
> 
> 90 Seconds with 3 people over 3.5/3.6million health means you need to  be sure each player is capable of following the mechanics AND pulling off around 12.6 -13.3k dps (some will fluctuate so allowing for execute power etc. Doing the above is the bare minimum required to successfully achieve a kill. SO there is a DPS check but it is extremely low so long as you follow those mechanics and don't have deaths or wipe.
> 
> **Heal or die!** - There is a debuff that will be applied to players where they will look like they have a damage shield on their bar but their health will be low. Basically they must out heal this and fill their bar back up or die. Much like the hoavar mechanics in Moongrave Fane.
> 
> **Marked for death!** - The boss will hit the tank with a spit type attack marking it for death, there will be a debuff to show this. If the player is hit by it again while this is on them they will die. SO the trick to this is simple. Swap tanks each time someone is marked for death and everything will be fine because the debuff timer will run off without having to be nuked...OR if you are VERY experienced tank, you can dodge roll it and then avoid it completely. BUT that will take some practice.
> 
> On normal you can actually survive it but on vet unless you dodgeroll/swap tanks, you will not
> 
> **Execute** - Under 31% the dragon will shout into the air and the screen will change hue slightly and now he will start targeting players in 3s! Basically stack and burn while following the basics but IF you are targeted with an aoe you must run to the side/back of the room and PLACE it on the ground before it falls off you. If it falls off in the group you are in trouble because people cannot stand in it, but if you drop it off at the sides and come back in, there will be no issues.
> 
> **HARDMODE!** - There are not many MAJOR differences in hardmode but there is already a lot going on so adding more spice can be tricky, but the changes are important!
> 
> Statues come to LIFE! These need to be killed and are easier to manage off the side or to the back AWAY from the dragon. That way most of the attacks will miss apart from the breath. These statues have a VERY specific mechanic.
> 
> They are immune to ALL damage until they start channeling. When they start channeling every single second will do more and more damage to the whole group. This is your chance to do damage. If you want to STOP the channel, interrupt it and it will go immune again for ages before doing so again. Rinse repeat.
> 
> The problem is if people are bash weaving or running skills which apply an interrupt, you will NEVER kill it. SO be sure NO ONE is using crushing shock or any interrutpt based skills. ONLY interrupt when your group agrees to and not just because it is pulsing with the red splashes. Once it is dead it is removed from the room and you can no longer hide behind it (note you have enough to hide behind for the whole fight).
> 
> Depending on downstairs portal people, you can skip the phase entirely but that is not what we are here to talk about. KNOW your mechanics
> 
> Downstairs portal has a twist. EVERYTHING about the mechanics are exactly the same, HOWEVER...The Servant now has 11.3 Million health!
> 
> Meaning EACH player that goes down need to be capable of pumping out 41.8k dps WHILE maintaining mechanics. Yes of course one person can have 50 while the other has 30 whatever, BUT essentially downstairs needs to be 125k dps between THREE people. So split it however you like but THAT'S the requirement.
> 
> So you don't NEED 90k-100k per PERSON! That would be 270-300k dps between you and you don't even need HALF of that to complete it #fact!
> 
> There IS a dps check for this fight, but almost 42k each in THIS current state of the game? is not hard to reach at all, especially if you already got to this boss so far in the first place!
> 
> Know your mechanics, don't fail the basics and even a player good with mechanics with NO cp can hit those numbers. Don't panic about dummy humping. Focus on applying yourself and not being dead!
> 
> During execute the Meteors on the floor do NOT fade away and you will have to make very good use of your space, especially if the group has lower dps. Sill 100% doable, but make sure you sue as much of the room as possible.
> 
> When the Portal spawns you will get two regular adds upstairs to deal with. You can put these ON the boss and fight them OR take them to one side and leave the dragon to it and come back after.
