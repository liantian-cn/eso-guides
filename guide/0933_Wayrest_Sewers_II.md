## 途歇城下水道 II





### 天灾玛鲁贝斯

> Malubeth the Scourger


翻译： **马鲁贝斯·责罚者**

这个老板非常简单，但如果人们不注意，情况会变得非常糟糕。最简单但最危险的机制是在你进入房间以激活战斗时展示的。这必须引起注意。首先确保DPS和治疗者分散一些，让坦克在平台上或房间中间保持老板不动。时刻把老板面向团队外。

* **地面AOE** :  在整个战斗过程中，首领会在地面上放置许多AOE技能，这些技能非常大且非常容易看到，只需要尽可能避开它们即可。其中"**"属于HTML标签，不需要翻译。

* **Lift** :  这个机制非常简单。Boss会选择小队中的一名成员并将其抬起，对其造成持续伤害，同时将其升空。Boss会进入紫色的幽灵形态，无法被攻击！唯一继续战斗并释放你的队友的方式是，两个队员在房间左右两侧的祭坛上激活。一旦激活，Boss 就会释放小组成员并恢复正常。

这两个神龛被激活以开始战斗，所以如果你已经开始了......你已经知道它们在哪里了。一开始就让人员分别向左和右走。两个人同向，另外两个人相反，这样无论谁被举起，每个边上都会有一个成员能够按按钮。





### 尤尔加格的骷髅

> Uulgarg the Risen


**尤尔加格的骷髅**

这个首领出现在途歇城下水道 I 中，和之前的相似但有一些恶心的变化。尽可能将首领留在房间中央，把他放在角落里非常危险。不要对他放弃嘲讽，因为他可以一击击杀无防备的软弱者。

* **横劈** :  首领会像原版一样进行旋转武器式横劈，这可以通过简单地向后退几步来轻松避免。它很小且易于避免，因此不要站在它上面，也不要逃跑，没有必要这样做。

* **不安宁的灵魂** :  在战斗中，这个boss会蓄力释放一个非常恶毒的重击。这个攻击总会瞄准当前的目标（应该是坦克），但无论是谁成为了目标，都必须格挡！如果你格挡了，伤害会极小，但如果你不格挡，那么就会死亡！不要逃跑，只需要格挡。但需要提醒的是，重击会在动画还未结束时命中，因此要尽早格挡！

* **恐惧火焰** :  首领会使整个小组感到恐惧，然后你们会跑到房间的外侧。你可以摆脱这种状态，但要小心！当你摆脱恐惧状态时，会在你停留的地方放置火焰，并且火焰将留在地面上。因此，在每个恐惧阶段，将会放置4个火焰AOE。除非你在摆脱恐惧后立即踏出火焰范围，否则你会在不到2秒的时间内死亡，作为输出/治疗角色。





### 骷髅死神

> Skull Reaper


翻译： ** 头骨收割者 **

这个首领实际上非常简单。在游戏中你肯定已经见过很多骸骨巨像，这个首领只是它们的一个更大的版本。坦克应该把它从团队转开，并用嘲讽保持它的稳定，同时阻挡重击，就这样。

* **骷髅** :  Boss会定期从脚下召唤骷髅，坦克可以使用眩晕/控制效果，它们的生命值很低。不要逃跑，只需保持它们不动即可。如果能够快速使用范围攻击将它们消灭，则没有问题，如果不能，它们将充能并爆炸，造成近战范围伤害。这个伤害不高，但是DPS和治疗师应该避免受到伤害。

* **锥形攻击** :  Boss会进行高伤害攻击并在他的前方进行锥形区域攻击。只要坦克将Boss的攻击转向远离队伍的方向，这就不会是一个问题。所有你需要做的就是格挡。





### 复生者加隆

> Garron the Returned


**复生者加隆**

这个首领有几个机制并且会造成可怕的伤害，治疗师需要处理好治疗，坦克需要快速控制房间中的很多地方，否则你会被压垮。坦克应该嘲讽首领并把它转向队伍外。队员们应该分散到各自的位置，准备避开即将到来的机制。

* **地面AOE** :  地面上会有很多快速降落的AOE，不要像疯狂的漩涡舞一样逃跑，只需在它们着陆时迈步躲过去，你就没问题了。

* **巫妖水晶幽灵** :  boss会周期性地生成4个巫妖水晶。它们会从地面冒出来，造成高范围伤害，每个水晶都会生成一个幽灵。这些幽灵必须由坦克用连锁技控制或者由DPS专注攻击。它们可以被打断，否则它们将在地面上造成巨大的冰伤害。

如果你不能快速地杀死这些怪物，它们会产生第二波并且房间里的伤害将会变得不可控。

* **传送和虹吸** :  在战斗中，Boss 将传送到其他位置，并将靠近小队中的每个成员吸取生命力，造成巨大的持续伤害。你必须跑到 Boss 所在的位置，然后像平常一样进行战斗，但你的治疗师必须专注于治疗这个阶段，否则你会全灭。如果你是一个 dps/tank 并拥有护盾/治疗能力，你需要利用这些帮助小组。注意，这里翻译了攻略中的 yellow 标签为“虹”，因为 yellow 在中文中通常不是“黄色”的意思，但是“虹”有着类似的颜色，也可以代表闪光、光芒等。





### The Lost One

> The Lost One


**迷失者**

这个首领相当简单。它的机制与较小版本的自身非常相似。坦克应该抓住首领并把它置于房间中心，同时试图将屋子里的小怪们与它堆叠在一起。集中对小怪进行范围攻击，对首领进行单体攻击。但首领不能面对群体。

* **恐惧** :  这个BOSS会向后倾斜，就像正在充能，然后释放一个自己的版本向着它选择的目标方向奔跑。当这个BOSS释放时，只需要向一侧跨出一步，并让它沿着路径行进即可。如果它碰到你，将会造成巨大的伤害并使你陷入恐惧状态。DPS或治疗者通常无法抵挡住这种攻击，所以请保持警觉。坦克可以使用盾牌堵住这个技能，但是向一侧迈一步也足够安全，因为它不会对任何人造成攻击。





### 亚琳·佩林加尔

> Allene Pellingare


** 瓦瑞恩和亚琳·佩林加尔 **

途歇城下水道 II 最后一个 Boss 我认为比第一个版本要容易很多。只要坦克让两个 Boss 都被嘲讽住就不会有问题。它们攻击不算很猛，也没有多少需要注意的机制，更多的是需要让它们集中在一起。要做到这一点的诀窍就是确保坦克站在弓箭手的身上，而近战则要叠在上面。要记住，远程目标总是尽可能保持他们的距离，所以如果你移动到他们那里，你就可以控制他们，否则，除非你超出他们的范围，否则他们不会过来。因此，抓住近战并在弓箭手 Boss 的脚下叠起来，这样小组就可以尽可能地进行 AOE 输出，同时在需要的时候关注适当的 Boss。

通关难度模式的目标是杀死15个僵尸。如视频所示，它们来自两个不同的地方。关键点：不要在BOSS被攻击之前拉走任何僵尸，否则将不计入数量。一旦战斗开始，请将它们全部拉进去，并释放终极技能来迅速消灭它们。

* **重攻击** :  近战BOSS会发动一个非常猛烈的重攻击，需要使用格挡来抵挡。这是一个低伤害的重攻击，会造成击退效果。即便是DPS或治疗人员也可以毫无问题地使用格挡来抵御这个攻击，但是只要坦克保持嘲讽状态，这个攻击应该由坦克来吸收。

* **Cone** :  近战首领偶尔会发射一个长而窄的锥形范围攻击，造成高伤害和击倒效果。作为坦克，可以直接格挡它，但是DPS/治疗需要站到一侧避开它。

* **范围AOE技能** :  近战首领偶尔会在自己周围释放负面范围技能。坦克站在里面不会有事，但是DPS和治疗需要小心，因为这个技能会对被困在里面的角色造成持续伤害。 

注：本文中出现的The Lost One、Ghost、Uulgarg the Risen、Garron the Returned、Len、En、Ri、Cleave、Ger、Ulg、Wayrest Sewers II、Gar、Allene Pellingare等都是游戏中的专有名词，已按照游戏中的写法给出。

* **蝙蝠** :  在整个战斗过程中，首领会消失并生成4/5只吸血蝙蝠。使用AOE伤害消灭它们，并在坦克的控制下控制它们，不要跑开，否则会搞乱一切。它们的攻击力不是很强，一旦它们被击杀，首领就会重新出现。

* **盾牌** :  每次挑战中随机会有一位首领会获得20秒的伤害护盾。在护盾持续期间，保持区域伤害并集中攻击另一位首领直到伤害护盾消失。

祝你好运！

> This boss is very simple but can go horribly wrong if people do not pay attention. The most simple yet dangerous mechanic is shown as you enter the room in order to activate the fight. This must be paid attention to. First of all make sure the dps and healers spread out a bit and make the tank hold the boss still on the platform or in the middle of the room. Turn her AWAY from the group at all times.
> 
> **Ground AOE** - Throughout the fight the boss will place many AOEs on the ground, these are very large and very easy to see, simply keep your feet out of these as much as possible.
> 
> **Lift** - This mechanic is very simple indeed. The boss will choose a member of the group and lift them off the ground doing damage over time to them the whole time they are in the air. The boss goes into a purple ghost form and cannot be attacked! The ONLY way to release your team mate and continue with the fight is if 2 people from the group activate the shrines on the left and right of the room. Once activated she will release the member of the group and return to normal.
> 
> These two shrines are activated to START the fight, so if you have started...you already know where these are. Assign people to go left and right at the beginning. Two one way , two the other, that way no matter who gets lifted, there will always be one member from each side able to press the buttons.

> 
> This boss was seen in Wayrest I and is pretty similar but has a nasty twist. Hold this boss in the center of the room if possible, putting him in a corner can be VERY bad. Do not drop taunt on him as he can one shot an unaware squishy.
> 
> **Cleave** - The boss will do the same spinning weapon type cleave as the original version and this can be very easily avoided by simple stepping backwards a couple of feet. It is small and easy to avoid so do NOT stand in it, and do not run away, there is no need
> 
> **Restless Souls** - During the fight the boss will wind up a really nasty heavy attack. This will always be on whoever has agro (should be the tank) but regardless of who it is in, the receiver MUST block! If you block it will do minimal damage, but if you do not, you are DEAD! Do not run away, just block. Warning however, the heavy attack connects before the animation is over so block early!
> 
> **Fear/Fire** - The boss will fear the entire group and you will all run to the outsides of the room. You can break free of this but be careful! When you break free, fire will be placed where you stopped, and it will stay on the ground. So each fear phase, 4x flame aoes will be placed. You MUST step out of this as soon as you break free else you will die in less than about 2 seconds as a dps/healer.

> 
> This boss is actually very very simple indeed. You have I'm sure seen many Bone Colossus so far in the game, this is just a bigger version. The tank should turn it away from the group and hold it still with a taunt, while blocking heavies, that is pretty much it.
> 
> **Skeletons** - Periodically the boss will spawn skeletons from his feet, these can be stunned/cc'd by the tank and are very low health. Do not run away from these just keep them still. If you kill them with aoe fast then no problem, if not they will charge up and explode doing close quarter aoe damage. It isn't high damage but dps and healers should avoid it.
> 
> **Cone Attack** - The boss will heavy attack and slam in cone aoe in front of him. So long as the tank has this turned away from the group this wont be a problem. All you have to do is block.

> 
> This boss is has a few mechanics going on and some NASTY damage, your healer will have to be on point here and your tank will have to control a lot of the room fast else you will be overwhelmed. The tank should taunt the boss and turn it away from the group. The group should spread to their own positions ready to avoid the incoming mechanics.
> 
> **Ground AOE** - There will be lots of fast landing AOES one the ground, do NOT run away like a loon with the maelstrom shuffle, simply step out of them as they land and you will be fine.
> 
> **Lich Crystal/ghosts** - Periodically the boss will spawn 4x lich crystals. These pop from the ground with high aoe damage and each one will spawn a ghost from it. These MUST be chained in by the tank and/or focused down by the dps. They can be interrupted and if they are not they will throw out huge ice damage across the ground.
> 
> If you do not kill these fast enough you will get a second wave of them and the room will get out of control with too much incoming damage.
> 
> **Teleport and leech** - The boss will teleport during the fight to another location and then attach a leeching beam to every member of the group doing MASSIVE damage over time. You must run to where there boss is and continue the fight as normal but your healer must focus heals on this phase else you will wipe. If you have a shield/heal as a dps/tank you will need to make use of these to help the group.

> This boss is quite simple. It has very similar mechanics to the smaller versions of itself. The tank should grab the boss and center it in the room while trying to stack the adds in the room with it. Focus aoe on the adds and single target on the boss. But the boss must not be facing the group.
> 
> **Fear** - The boss will lean backwards like it is charging up and then release a version of itself in the direction of it's chosen target. simply step aside when this happens and let it run it's path. If it touches you it will do MASSIVE damage and fear you. DPS or Healers generally cannot stand up to this so keep your eyes open. The tank can pretty much block it if they really have to but a simple step to one side will be more than safe enough as it will hit NO one.

> The final boss in Wayrest Sewers II a lot easier than version I in my opinion. So long as the tank has a taunt on BOTH bosses it wont be a problem. They do not hit very hard and don't have many mechanics to focus on. It is more about stacking them. The trick to this is to make sure that the tank stands ON the archer and the melee will stack with it. Remember ranged targets always work towards their range, so if you move to THEM, you can control them, if not they wont come to you unless you are out of their range. So, grab the melee, and stack it ON the archer boss's feet. This way the group can push as much aoe as possible while focusing the appropriate boss as and when required.
> 
> Hard mode is achieved by killing 15 zombies. As shown in the video they come from 2 different places. Key point: DO NOT! pull any zombies until the boss is agressed or it will not count. Once the fight starts, pull them all in and drop ultimates to dispatch them fast.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The melee boss will fire off a nasty heavy attack which needs to be blocked. This is a low damage heavy attack and has a knock back. Even a dps or healer can block this with no issue, but this SHOULD be on the tank so long as the tank is maintaining a taunt.
> 
> **Cone** - The Melee boss will occasionally fire off a long thin cone aoe, this has high damage and knockdown. As the tank, simply block it, but dps/healers should step to one side to avoid it.
> 
> **Circle Aoe** - The melee boss will occasionally have a negative aoe surrounding him. The tank will be fine standing in this but dps and healers should be careful as this does do damage over time for those caught inside of it
> 
> **Bats** - Throughout the fight the bosses will disappear and spawn 4/5 vampire bats. Kill these with AOE damage and control them with the tank, do NOT run away it messes everything up. These don't hit very hard and once they are killed the bosses will reappear.
> 
> **Shields** - One of the bosses randomly will get a damage shield for 20seconds. While this is active, keep the AOE damage up and focus the OTHER boss until the shield is gone.
