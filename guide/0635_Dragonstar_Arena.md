## 龙星竞技场





### 勇士马卡尔德

> CHAMPION MARCAULD


**竞技场一：勇士马卡尔德**

这个首领非常简单，坦克应该始终保持所有攻击者的仇恨并阻挡重击。小组应该始终呆在BOSS的后方，否则就会被邪恶的范围攻击能力打中。这可以是一场相当流动的战斗，所以坦克必须密切注意首领在战斗中可能会重新定位！

* **重击** :  名称就很简单了，这个重击会造成高物理伤害并使目标击倒。坦克需要确保格挡这个攻击。如果DPS或治疗被这个攻击打到，他们应该尝试适时闪避它，或者格挡它，希望他们不会被秒杀。这个技能通常应该一直对准坦克。因此，请务必确保你的嘲讽技能不会失效！

* **破晓者** :  这个Boss会释放一个类似于玩家版本的正面AOE破晓者攻击。它会造成巨大的伤害并使目标失去平衡。坦克应该格挡或者直接躲开这个攻击，但是团队（输出和治疗）不应该受到这个攻击的打击。它有可能秒杀任何不是坦克或没有做好准备的人。因为它是正面AOE攻击，所以理所当然的，坦克必须始终将Boss面向远离团队的方向！

* **增援怪物** :  战斗中会有增援怪物出现。第一波会和BOSS一起刷新，第二波会在BOSS血量降至75%时刷新，第三波会在40%时刷新。

这些小怪都各不相同，有双持武器的、施法者、治疗者和双手武器使用者。如果这些小怪被控制住，它们就会很容易被击败。因此，坦克应该把它们引到BOSS附近并在位置上控制住它们，而小队则应该使用范围攻击杀死它们（或者根据小队配置和DPS输出分别集中攻击它们）。治疗者必须中断，以防止它们治愈，而双手武器使用者如果重击任何人都必须格挡。它们的攻击非常强大，可以一击杀死一个毫不知情的玩家！如果它们开始在周围充能圆形AOE，则也需要中断它们。如果成功爆发，将会造成高伤害。

在最后一个包里，你必须特别小心，有一个持剑盾并背着旗帜的小兵。这个敌人一定要优先攻击。它有恶心的群攻和非常猛烈的攻击力。坦克必须立即吸引它的注意力，而小队应该尽一切可能优先攻击这个目标。

* **守护之环** :  BOSS 偶尔会在地面上施放一个守护之环。坦克必须注意这个技能。当 BOSS 和任何小兵站在守护之环内时，它会给 BOSS 增加抗性并快速治疗 BOSS。作为坦克，你必须时刻让 BOSS 远离守护之环，否则这将是一个极其漫长的战斗！

简单笔记：保持BOSS静止，背向团队。将小怪引入BOSS周围，集中火力攻击小怪直到它们死亡。每次看到守护之环时，重新调整BOSS位置。





### 亚弗尼·冰肤

> YAVNI FROST-SKIN


** 竞技场二: 亚弗尼·冰肤和凯蒂·变冰人 **

这个首领很简单，但是有一些相当恶心的元素需要注意。其中一个是远程的，一个是近战的，因此坦克必须理解如何处理远程与仇恨。如果远程目标无法接近坦克(它会追到范围内)，则远程目标只会向坦克走。然而，近战目标始终会跟随得非常近。所以这场战斗的诀窍是同时嘲讽两个首领，但是将近战首领尽可能靠近远程首领。不是反过来。(好的坦克知道这一点，新的坦克需要练习)。将它们尽可能靠在一起，并且不惜一切代价，使它们背对着团队。

输出和治疗角色应该始终待在敌人背后，而不是前面！首先集中攻击法师，她是你的主要目标！

* **篝火** :  在这个战斗中，你必须遵循竞技场的基本机制。如果你能走到这一步，你应该已经点亮了篝火至少两次。如果这场 boss 战斗进行得太长，篝火就会熄灭，你必须重新点亮它，要注意这个机制，否则每个人都会被冻死。

* **ADDS** :  在这场战斗中，大约在合并BOSS生命值条的50%左右和26%左右会有许多小怪，坦克很难控制它们。因此，首先人们需要不要惊慌！不要像无头苍鸡一样到处乱跑，根据需要躲避和格挡并保持专注。

需要处理附加生物，因此在地面上放置足够的群体攻击来帮助应对它们，并根据敌人的重要性和危险性集中攻击个体。

弓箭手是你的头号优先目标。坦克需要迅速将他们锁定并控制住，他们必须被击杀，因为他们造成的伤害巨大，如果被活活留下来，会成为真正的问题。

巨魔很容易处理，只需要坦克把它们抓住，其他人远离它们。

近战敌人和施法者通常都很弱，不过那个背后插了旗帜的家伙一定要先集火。如果他向玩家发动重击，除非防御格挡，否则玩家就会死亡。所以要小心，保持警惕！

**变冰人凯蒂（毁灭法杖技能）**

* **冰根** :  她会释放一个频道技能，通常在目标上有仇恨的坦克。需要打断此技能。如果没有打断，她会放置一个地面伤害区域，并对受到影响的玩家造成高伤害并以冰冻根系束缚其。你需要进行翻滚或等待其到期才能脱离束缚。作为dps/治疗，你不想被此技能击中，所以要时刻留意她并准备打断！

* **冰墙** :  凯蒂偶尔会在地面上释放一个元素冰墙，它会对你造成高额的持续伤害，并减速/定身你。它在地面上呈现为一个类似于冲锋能力的大型条形AOE，应该避免它。

* **暴风** :  当她的血量较低时，她会在周围释放一个大型的圆形范围攻击，造成持续的高额寒冰伤害，只需躲在范围之外直到攻击结束或她被击败即可。

亚弗尼·冰肤（双手武器技能）

* **重击升天击** :  这个Boss非常简单，他的攻击非常强力且有很多基本攻击。要避免的主要攻击是他的重击/升天击。他会试图升天击住有仇恨的人（通常是坦克）。你必须阻挡这个攻击，否则你将被抛向空中并向后倒退！

* **Cleave** :  除了普通攻击，他有时会施展横劈技能。这是一个快速的前方范围攻击。虽然这并不会造成太大的伤害问题，但是DPS和治疗者应该尽可能避免它。简单来说，就是不要站在BOSS面前！





### 那卡塔

> NAK'TAH


**竞技场三: 那卡塔和西利亚**

这个竞技场很痛苦，但如视频所描述和演示，当然有办法与你的团队协同合作，使它变得非常简单，几乎是 foolproof，特别是当涉及到毒药时。但老板有点棘手，特别是因为其中一个是远程角色，喜欢四处奔波和传送。因此，坦克和团队必须不要恐慌，必须集中精力控制自己和敌人。你可以在它们生成的位置上抗住它们，但这非常冒险，当毒药出现时大多数人会死于它，因此如果你不喜欢在生成点上堆叠，则下面将解释更安全的位置。

坦克应尝试嘲讽两位首领并朝着东部出生点区域奔跑。这将把远程首领放到角落里。一旦首领在那里，再次走回去并将其固定在那里，同时将近战叠放在其上。这个角落是房间内所有大型毒液爆发的安全区域（所以没有毒液一击必杀！）。

团队应该首先集中攻击法师/施法者老板。近战很容易定位，但法师比较棘手。

* **扼杀者** : 房间的四个角落有扼杀者，战斗期间他们会把人拉到他们的位置。如果你在毒液爆发期间被拉走并在中途穿过毒液，你将会死亡。因此，最好是有一个DPS在这些扼杀者出现时去杀死他们。他们的血量不高，应该不难击败。但是，如果将他们留在那里不管，就会变得非常乱，所以要小心，并记住在角落间不要靠近毒液。在视频中有安全的地点可以待着！

* **增援** :  大约在53%左右，房间里会出现增援。这些增援可能会让你进退两难，所以一定要确保你在地面上放置了足够的AOE技能。虽然它们的生命值不是很高，但如果你不小心的话它们可能会压倒你。

巫师需要被锁定并在他们还活着时打断，否则他们会在地面上施放大规模范围攻击，你的团队将很难存活。

尼里德必须尽快被聚焦！他们是你的优先目标！

* **瓦马苏** :  瓦马苏会在Boss的血量降至40-45％时刷新。你必须集中攻击它，坦克需要将它引到队伍中并把它的面朝外。所有的DPS / 治疗都应该时刻留在它的身后。它有一个前方AOE和令人讨厌的电击伤害攻击，所以必须尽快击败它，而不管房间中的其他敌人。如果瓦马苏存活时间过长，你就会遇到麻烦。

**那卡塔（风暴召唤技能）**

* **闪电冲锋** :  这个Boss非常难缠，有时候会主动靠近玩家并进行冲锋，使得后退十分困难。但有时候会出现想要的位置，此时玩家一定要全体站在Boss身后。因为Boss将会发动一个强力攻击，只有坦克才可以硬扛。

* **攻略
超载** :  正如你所猜测的，这个首领是一个巫师，具有巫师的能力。 如果首领靠近，它有时会决定施放超载！ 它会释放一个巨大的范围锥形法术，并持续造成高电击伤害。 坦克可以站在那里格挡这个技能，但所有的DPS /治疗人员都应该避开它，否则很可能会死亡。

**闪电形态** – 跟巫师职业一样，这个首领也能进入闪电形态。抗性会增加，而且过于接近会每秒受到电击伤害。你可以在范围外使用近战攻击，因为它的暴击范围相当小，但是你不想长时间待在范围内。

* **液态闪电** :  首领会在地面施放一个中型圆形AOE，会造成持续的闪电伤害，请不要站在其中。"span"是HTML标签，不翻译。

**西利亚（双持技能）**

* **Cripple** :  这个boss会施放/引导技能几秒钟，需要一个打断。如果没有打断，将使玩家残废并将其震晕在地（他们必须挣脱），同时给他们施加一个持续的出血伤害。打断这个机制，它就不会成为问题！

* **旋转获胜** :  这个首领偶尔会释放钢铁旋风（旋转并攻击范围内的所有目标）。虽然看起来很危险，但实际上他的攻击并不强。你可以格挡它，或者通过治疗来应对它。

简要说明：保持团队同在一起，把两个首领聚在一起，需要时打断技能，专注于击杀小兵，特别是瓦姆莎（Wamasu），如果需要，派人去击杀散兵游勇。坦克把首领面向远离队友的方向，DPS从后面攻击。贴着角落站，以避免受到毒性范围攻击（安全区）。





### 大地之心骑士

> EARTHEN HEART KNIGHT


**竞技场四：大地之心骑士**

这个首领可以很容易击败，也可以很混乱。这完全取决于团队理解机制和协调的能力。坦克应该当然会嘲讽和尽可能在所有时候保持首领不动，同时将首领转向团队远离团队，但如果你想保持安全和效率，这是一个相当活动的战斗。因此，坦克将不时地重新定位首领，具体取决于房间中正在发生的情况。放松并专注，不要放掉首领！

* **德蕾丝家族剥削者** :  这是关键!他们会在一个玩家身上放置白色的光束。这个光束会在一段时间内造成高额伤害，因此需要治疗来应对。光束消失后，受影响的玩家脚下会出现一个剥削者暗影。

此战略关键在于控制。如果你被定为目标，就跑到地图的边缘（墙壁或角落）等待目标结束。一旦目标结束，就躲避攻击并回到团队中。这样可以将暗影故意放置在边缘，远离团队。

每个德莱斯之家的压迫者都应该被击杀。这就是坦克的作用。如果坦克简单地将Boss堆起来，他们可以被AOE杀死。如果不方便，可以先杀死小怪，然后回到Boss。这将很快，所以你必须要注意。

注意：奴役者在光束结束后会掉落暗影（放置位置很关键），但如果你在光束结束前将其杀死，它将在你所在的位置掉落，这可能会在团队中造成危险。小心！

* **奴役者暗影** :  这些从光束中生成。它们在重复的圆形范围内猛烈地挥舞着剑。如果你被困在其中，你可能只需要两次攻击就会死亡。因此，当你把它们放在两侧时，你必须快速躲开它们的路线，不要站在范围内，并且如果这些被放置在团队中，保持距离！

不要试图击杀这些敌人，它们具有很高的生命值，你在杀死它们的时候会被它们淹没。所以简单地把它们扔到边缘并忽略它们。小心脚下。

* **增援** :  在大约70％和30％时刻刷新，它们只是小小的麻烦。每次出现一个法师和一个壳蟹类型。它们通常会很快死于AOE伤害，但请确保及时消灭它们，以免引起太多麻烦。

* **化石** :  首领自然是一个龙骑士，并且具有大地之心技能线的龙骑士能力之一 - 化石。首领会选择一个随机目标并将其包裹在石头中。可以通过翻滚来躲避它，但如果被抓住，只需求助他人解救。

* **喷发** :  Boss会在地面上释放一个小的圆形AOE，不断造成火焰伤害一段时间。不同于玩家版本的喷发，这个并不会持续18秒，释放速度相当快。只需要远离它就好了。

* **火岩护盾** :  BOSS 偶尔会施加伤害护盾，只需继续攻击 BOSS 直到打破它，或者等待它消失即可。这里没有什么压力。

* **BASH（巴什）** :  这个BOSS会对坦克（或者谁引起了仇恨，通常是坦克）进行一次旋转攻击。玩家需要简单地格挡这个攻击。如果你失败了，你将被击倒并受到高额伤害。此外，被击退也很危险，因为你可能会被扔进房间内的所有AOE中。因此，请务必注意不要错过格挡！

简单说明：坦克需要将首领聚集在奴役者身上。被奴役者照射的玩家应该移动到边缘并丢掉暗影（不要费时间杀死暗影）。优先击杀奴役者，其次再击杀首领。





### 阿那拉·图哈

> ANAL'A TU'WHA


**竞技场5: 阿那拉·图哈**

这个Boss很简单，但如果你想保持“安全”，需要一些重新定位。坦克应该把Boss抱在他生成的地方，将它转向远离团队的方向，团队应该始终呆在Boss身后，并注意地面范围攻击。

* **影子施法者** :  这场战斗中有两位影子施法者。这就是为什么坦克需要重新调整BOSS位置的原因。第一个施法者在战斗开始时就出现了。所以请让BOSS保持静止，同时集中攻击并消灭这个施法者。如视频所示，必须尽快消灭影子施法者。如果你没有在时间内消灭掉它而人们被诅咒了，那么你必须找到一个发光的板子并站在上面进行清洗，以避免爆炸死亡。

在BOSS的生命值降至约40%时，竞技场西门也会投射出第二个暗影，需要集中攻击。所以，只需要先击败第一个暗影，然后把BOSS带到另一个门口进行余下的战斗即可。

**增援敌人！**——增援敌人会在首领血量百分比达到一定阈值时出现。第一波出现在100%时（暗影施法者和一个石像鬼），作为坦克，你必须将石像鬼背向团队，并格挡它们的重击。另外，石像鬼会猛击地面，当这样的情况出现时，请远离范围，在结束后再回来。非常容易看到。

第二波大约在78％左右，会有一个刺客，一个双手武器持有者，一个蝎子和一个石像鬼。只需将这些怪物堆叠在Boss身上，并使用AOE技能杀死它们。作为DPS /治疗者，请再次小心不要被重袭，也不要站在石像鬼前面，同时注意双手武器持有者对团队进行重击的攻击。

第三波添加的是一个附近的火法师。虽然是个孤立的添加，但攻击力惊人。坦克需要尽快将其拉回战斗中来！如果它有机会释放技能，您必须打断它。如果您失败了，它将在地面上释放一条火线，根据抵抗等级，可能会一击杀死输出职业。所以要小心！

* **旗帜** :  首领会在地面上掉落一个龙骑士战旗。在旗帜内你会受到大量的火焰伤害，千万不要站在里面！

* **重击** :  这很简单明了。Boss将会对坦克（或者谁拥有仇恨）使用升天击。记住一定要格挡，否则你将被击飞并承受高额伤害。

* **Elder Scrolls Online 游戏攻略翻译
光环不稳定护甲** :  BOSS 身上有光环，会让 BOSS 周围的区域充满负面效果。一定不要长时间待在光环内，会造成高额持续伤害，并快速击杀输出/治疗职业。在进行攻击时一定注意与 BOSS 的距离，近战职业仍可以站在外面攻击。

* **吐息** :  这个BOSS显然是一个龙骑士，具有相应的技能，他可以吐火！这是一个锥形范围攻击，所有被捕捉在范围内的玩家会承受随时间递增的火焰伤害。确保随时进行治疗，以防发生意外，但通常情况下，只要不在BOSS的面前，你就不会遭受攻击。

简单提示：在原地坦住BOSS并且在开局时击败暗影施法者和小兵。一旦暗影施法者被打倒，把BOSS带到西门口（或在其血量低于40%前）并且击败另一个暗影施法者。在应对小兵的同时继续击败BOSS并且远离范围伤害。总体来说，这场战斗非常简单。





### 远射手皮斯娜

> PISHNA LONGSHOT


**竞技场六：远射手皮斯娜**

这个Boss比看起来简单得多，但你必须关注她的动画。坦克应该在她生成的地方把Boss抓住，小队应该站在一个给予足够空间的阵型中。每个人都需要有自己独立的站立位置，远离其他人（治疗和伤害输出者应该形成一个稳固的三角形阵型）。如果你们挤在一起，你就无法知道她会攻击谁，一定要散开！无论你是近战还是远程，重要的是不能堆在一起。这在视频中得到了清晰的展示。阵型是关键。

* **射击耗能** :  这是你必须远离其他成员的主要原因。如果你们是成三角形的队形（DPS和治疗），你可以清楚地看到她瞄准的是哪个人。她会随机选择一个目标，开始进行长时间施放的射击。如果你是被瞄准的玩家，你必须精确地进行闪避来避免它。如果闪避失败，将会造成巨大的伤害并完全耗尽你的资源。如果你们靠在一起，就不可能看到谁被瞄准，人们会死亡！形成队形，集中注意力，看清机制并及时反应！不要逃跑，如果你现在还没有明白游戏规则，那逃跑是无法拯救你的。

* **箭雨** :  这是一个非常简单的远程锥形范围攻击。如果你看到了这个技能的指示器，请简单地向一侧躲闪以避免受到伤害。像游戏中的许多弓箭手一样，这个技能可以很容易地被躲避，但如果被攻击到，你将会受到高额的持续伤害。

* **怪物增援** :  增援怪物会在生命值百分比达到一定数值时出现。第一波增援出现在100%血量时，第二波出现在血量降至约70%时，第三波出现在血量降至40%时。

这些附加敌人你之前已经见过，但你将面对弓箭手、狼人、藤蔓怪和小精灵。每个人都应该被引入团队，大多数情况下会随着Aoe而死亡，但你应该首先攻击藤蔓怪，因为它是最难缠的。但是要注意，不要在房间里到处跳舞。如果你没有把他们摆放好，他们将四散而这就会让事情变得混乱。广泛分布的击杀是不好的！敌人在地板上掉落了一个绿色的圆圈，这些圆圈每次都会恢复体力，但也会造成巨大的伤害。如果他们分散在整个房间里，很难避免。如果他们都在一个地方，那么就更容易避开了。因此，控制好这些敌人并看好你的脚下，记住，始终保持对BOSS的注意力和队形！

简要说明：将首领保持在中央，保持整齐的队形。如果你被瞄准了，请使用闪避技能，并消灭靠近首领的小怪。不要像一个没有头的鸡一样四处乱跑。





### 黑暗法师

> DARK MAGE


**竞技场七：黑暗法师和暗影骑士**

这些首领有两个方面，非常简单，也是一场噩梦！这全取决于小队的协调和了解基本机制。坦克应该始终试图将骑士叠加在法师身上，并密切关注他们的行动。这场战斗需要大量的打断！不要放弃嘲讽！

* **献祭** :  你已在这个竞技场中看到过它们，但现在更重要的是要注意它们。北部、西部和东部区域将出现献祭（两个普通的和一个装甲的）。这些必须尽快成为主要攻击目标。如果它们没有在到达祭坛之前被杀死，它们将召唤巨大的恶魔，你将不得不与BOSS们一起战斗。我们说的是蜘蛛恶魔、恶魔和各种恶心的东西。杀死献祭！

* **攻略翻译如下
战斗开始时第一波献祭者会出现所以要尽快击败它们接下来的几波会在首领总血量达到70、50及15** : 18%时出现。

* **增援** :  战斗期间，将会在首领生命值条的特定健康程度时出现增援。在大约70%的健康程度时，你将遇到一只Daedroth。他必须尽快处理，因为他有一些令人讨厌的击退、晕眩和吐息攻击。应该将他引入战斗与首领一起，并将他背向小队，尽快杀死他。

25%的时候，房间内会出现一只Clanfear(兽人)和两只魔人（一个法师，一个盾牌），它们的攻击非常厉害，如果它们重攻击、施法或跳跃攻击你，你必须格挡。坦克应该把它们拉到Boss战里。此阶段它们应该比较容易用群体攻击解决，但如果你遇到麻烦，就集中攻击它们，快速将它们解决掉。

**黑暗法师（黑暗魔法技能）**

* **魔法无效泡泡** :  首领有一个魔法无效泡泡，它对你不友好！千万不要进去。它会眩晕人，防止使用魔法能力，会造成持续性伤害，如果留在里面将会灭掉整个团队。

确保将你的终极技能保存到此效果消失后再使用，否则你的终极技能将被魔法无效/移除。

* **水晶碎片** :  BOSS将释放一个召唤卡住的水晶碎片! 这个技能伤害极高，可以将一个DPS/治疗职业打飞，并且几乎可以秒杀！它会随机选择一个目标并必须打断！

* **Daedric Mines** :  首领会在自己周围放置Daedric Mines。如果你站在它们里面，它们会爆炸并晕眩你。尽量不要站在它们里面。但是，如果坦克使用了Mist Form，它们可以在首领周围快速跑动形成一个圆圈，并使它们全部爆炸（消除问题）。

* **魔法炸弹** :  首领将挥舞她的法杖进行一项技能，并且在完成后会释放一枚基于魔法的巨大伤害炸弹，它会落地并在大范围内爆炸。这个技能一定要被打断！

* **爆发** :  BOSS将会飘浮并施放某个技能，成功施放后会对AOE范围内的目标造成伤害。一定要打断！

**暗影骑士（黎明之怒技能）**

* **重型攻击** :  这是一个非常简单的视觉提示，敌人会发出一次重型攻击，攻击目标通常是坦克或者仇恨最高的人物，玩家需要使用格挡来避免受到巨大伤害和击退效果。

* **新星** :  这个一定要避免！不仅这个黑暗法师有一个魔法无效泡泡，而且这个家伙还有一个新星！如果他放了这个技能，尽快走开，它会造成巨大伤害。

* **吸血鬼诅咒反射之光** :  首领会对玩家施加单目标持续伤害，造成高额伤害。需要通过治疗或净化/清除来解决。

* **净化之光** :  老板会在一个玩家身上施放净化之光，累积持续伤害，6秒后爆发出伤害，就像圣骑士玩家拥有的技能一样。一旦它爆发出来，它会在地面上留下一个治疗效果，供老板治疗使用。如果可能的话，让老板远离拥有这种效果的目标，这样他就不会被治疗了。

* **黑暗闪耀** :  BOSS会连接并对玩家进行单一目标攻击。打断攻击以避免发生。

简单说明：一旦献祭被召唤出来，立即优先攻击它们。攻击法师，确保打断它的所有技能！法师死亡后，专注于攻击骑士，同时避免新星技能和击败小怪。一旦法师死亡，战斗就会变得轻松得多！





### 马维斯·泰尔纳里斯

> MAVUS TALNARITH


**竞技场八：马维斯·泰尔纳里斯**

这个首领看起来比实际简单得多，但一切都取决于节奏。然而，过度输出或缺乏关注可能导致非常快的灭团。坦克需要时刻嘲讽并稳住首领，而小队需要分散并找到自己的空间。

* **冰霜彗星流星** :  BOSS会随机选择一个目标并向其发射一颗流星。不要躲开，这就是为什么要保持距离，以便看出谁是目标。当流星在传送时，你会在脚下看到一圈点。当你看到这个时，格挡！一旦流星落地, 然后远离地面上留下的AOE。

* **火山符文** :  Boss会在地面上施放符文，不要站在上面，否则它们会爆炸，你会被抛起并受到极大的火焰伤害。

* **火焰轨迹** :  BOSS将会沉淀法术并在地面上释放出一道火焰轨迹。如果DPS或治疗站在轨迹上，就会被秒杀，所以要注意避开。然而，这个技能可以被打断，所以尽快使用巴什来打断他，避免这个机制的发动！

* **小兵** :  首领会有一些基础小兵。应该专注于消灭它们，让它们离开战场。它们有毒炎和重攻击，你不希望在应对即将到来的机制时让它们存活。

他的身边在100%时会生成两个法师，80%时会生成一个双手武器持有者。一定要处理掉它们，如果它们逃脱出去会是一个很大的问题。

* **百夫长** :  这就是你不想狂轰乱炸boss的原因。在这场战斗中，会生成两波百夫长，一波在80%，另一波在40%。如果你试图疯狂输出，可能会同时遭受太多攻击。

红色的会随机攻击玩家，黄色的会尝试横劈，蓝色的会向空中射击并在随机两个玩家身上施加诅咒。这就是麻烦的地方。必须打断蓝色敌人的这个技能！

如果你没有成功打断蓝色自动机器人，一个玩家身边会出现一圈冰法术伤害，另一个玩家身边会出现一圈火法术伤害。这两个玩家必须尽快完美地重叠在一起，并保持在一起直到这两个法术伤害消失。

按照这种方式堆叠它们将会抵消彼此的范围效果并使其消失。如果你没能做到这一点，两名玩家都将被炸死。

所以，打断蓝色千里眼就不会有问题了!

简单说明：打到BOSS的80％，然后杀死Centurions（中断蓝色的Centurion的攻击），再在40％时重复这个步骤。其余时间，保持阵型，分散开来并阻止冰彗星。在40％后，如果所有的小怪都死了，就只需要“杀死他！”即可。





### 吸血鬼大君斯萨

> VAMPIRE LORD THISA


**竞技场九：吸血鬼大君斯萨**

这个首领其实相当简单，但却有一个不寻常的机制，在这场战斗之前你应该已经见过了。坦克应该从她的生成点抓住首领并将她保持在门附近。将她转过身面向团队的背面，团队的其他人应该始终呆在她的背后并注意脚下的位置！

* **蝙蝠群** :  BOSS会施放蝙蝠群（与吸血鬼技能系玩家技能相同）。它的影响范围非常大，只持续约5秒，但是如果你被击中，你会伤害自己并恢复她的健康。因此，务必要尽一切可能避免这种情况。在影响范围内的人越多，她恢复的健康值就越多。

* **重击** :  首领将对坦克（或者拥有仇恨的角色）进行重击，要避免被击倒，需要使用格挡。如果你不格挡，就会被击倒。

* **新生力量** :  在这场战斗中，会出现骷髅和愤怒的敌人，必须立即应对。坦克应确保始终嘲讽并控制它们的位置，而团队需要优先消灭它们。特别是愤怒的敌人需要迅速击败。它有令人讨厌的冰攻击，可以被打断，但如果不打断，将会对DPS玩家和可能的治疗师造成即死攻击。

这些出生在首领产生100％生命值的开始同时，当它的生命值降至40％时再次出现，所以要保持警惕。

* **战旗** :  这位吸血鬼是一位龙骑士，并且会掉落一面龙骑士战旗。如果这件事发生了，马上离开或者就会死亡！它会对你造成巨大的持续性伤害，你不会希望被困在其中。

* **跳跃旋转攻击** :  这个boss偶尔会突然爆发出火焰，然后用盾牌进行一次巨大的跳跃旋转攻击瞄准坦克。这可以格挡，但是也是范围攻击，所以身边的其他人也应该进行格挡或是被击倒。

* **迷雾形态** :  首领将会转化为雾状/烟雾状。在这个阶段，他会对小队造成范围伤害，并极大地减少受到的伤害。不要在她处于迷雾形态时浪费你的好东西，而是在她恢复实体时狠狠攻击她！

* **不稳定盔甲** :  类似第五轮，这个Boss有一个BUFF，会给她周围带来负面伤害效果，尽量不要站在范围内。它的范围不是特别大，但是输出的伤害很高。

* **Rubyn Jonnicent  Zackael Jonnicent** :  这两个人打击力很强。坦克需要尽快吸引他们的注意力！其中一个是使用双手武器的耐力魔法师，会走近并且会发出重攻击，必须格挡。另一个是魔法魔法师，会进行远距离的水晶碎片攻击，必须打断，否则玩家一击必杀。只要他们的幽灵存在（单独的链接实体），每次攻击不能造成超过“1”的伤害。

当这些家伙在房间里时，两个输出应该跳进其中一个坑（那些你需要避免有手出来的坑）。当这发生时，治疗师和坦克会留在楼上。坦克需要准备好新的增援单位的位置，以便输出回到战斗中，而治疗师则需要维持他/她的生命值。

同时，楼下的两个DPS遇到了敌人的幽灵/灵魂以及一些更难的小怪。你必须击败它们，不死，并在它们倒下后通过传送门。传送门会将你送回楼上。

现在幽灵已经死亡，其他小怪会受到完整伤害，必须优先攻击它们！

简单说明：坦克将BOSS面向团队背面，并将小怪引到身边。团队分散并远离AOE。当Jonnicents（一种种族）进来时，两个DPS到楼下杀死鬼魂，然后回来完成任务。 

详细攻略: 
1. 首先，团队需要切换好物品和技能，以适应这个战斗。

2. 一旦战斗开始，坦克应该将BOSS引向战场边缘，以确保BOSS不会面向团队。坦克应该尽量将小怪引到身边，以防他们对其他团队成员造成伤害。

3. 在坦克控制BOSS的同时，其他团队成员应该分开站立，以避免受到BOSS的AOE伤害。如果你站在一起，那么你所有的人都会受到AOE伤害，这将对你的治疗和治愈造成额外的压力。

4. 当Jonnicents出现时，他们会带来一些鬼魂。两个DPS奔向楼下杀死鬼魂，然后返回战场完成任务。

5. 当BOSS血量降到一定程度时，他会开始施放一些非常强有力的技能。在这种情况下，坦克必须保持他们面对远离团队，以确保他们不会受到这些技能的影响。

6. 如果你没有足够的团队成员来完成任务，那么你可能需要花时间训练你的角色，或者寻找更多的玩家来帮助你。





### 战斗大师西亚斯

> HIATH THE BATTLEMASTER


**竞技场十：最终BOSS：战斗大师西亚斯**

这个boss已经和你谈了整场VDSA，最终你终于可以杀了他！但是有一些复杂但同时又很简单的机制。这可能非常顺利，或者非常糟糕。是的，有很多作弊的视频，告诉你如何欺骗机制（让我们面对它，通常会以多次困难的尝试中失败而告终...），但我在这里解释实际的“机制”是如何设计和工作的！

所以，大家去地图的最后位置，那里有一个开放的平原区域，坦克应该在那里的中心把他拉住。而剩下的团队成员则在他身后形成一个不错的半圆形。每个人都需要自己的空间。

**烈焰！**——战斗开始时，Boss会对所有人进行火球攻击。这将在每个玩家下面释放一个火焰圆圈。在这里，你需要所有人分别前往4个安全的角落（分开并站在边缘），并且生存下来。几秒钟后，火焰圈将爆炸并落在地上，在每个火焰圈中会出现一个火焰元素。效果已不再影响你，所以回到中间继续战斗。

* **注意这似乎是在定时器上（每60** : 75秒一次），但最重要的是注意它何时发生并将自己的AOE放到小组之外。这个竞技场有3个主要岛屿，因此如果需要（如果你被压倒了），可以使用所有岛屿。

* **火焰阿托拉克** :  如上所述，每个火焰范围效果都会产生一个阿托拉克。坦克应该把它们带入与主要Boss的战斗中，小队应该集中攻击它们。它们每个只有500k生命值，所以如果你在一个高输出的小组里，几个终极技能就足够了，只需要范围伤害。放松心态，不要逃跑，它们实际上并没有看起来那么可怕！

* **重击** :  Boss会消失一秒钟，然后通过重击从隐身状态出来。必须格挡。

* **致命披风** :  与致命披风非常相似，首领会自我加强一个围绕着他的AOE效果。这会对任何被困其中的人造成适中的伤害。看好自己的位置，不要在里面待太久，或者确保你有强有力的治疗来支撑。

* **灵魂撕裂** :  就像夜刃职业大招一样，当boss跳到空中时将会在范围内造成眩晕效果。在他发动接下来的攻击之前，你需要先打破这个状态来解除眩晕。

* **看那边** :  BOSS有时候会像一个忍者妖精一样跳过坦克! 他已经换位置了，不要惊慌，只需保持嘲讽并重新进入队形。

* **钢铁风暴** :  除了基础攻击外，他有时会释放出一些钢铁风暴，对范围内的所有人造成物理伤害。不要惊慌，你可以格挡它，或治愈自己。

* **Cripple** :  BOSS将会发动cripple效果，这将会使被选择的目标眩晕。如果你受到攻击，只需摆脱效果，不过在此之前你也可以通过打断来完全避免效果。

* **深呼吸吸入机制r** :  在50%和25%时，首领会发动大约3秒的通道技能，并引发一个巨大的“吸入”机制。他会拉近玩家，然后立刻在火焰中爆炸。这造成巨大的伤害，因此必须被格挡/削弱。击中后，治疗师需要快速使人们回到高健康状态，然后才能试图用钢铁风暴结束人类生命。

* **新星** :  当Boss的血量降至约40%时，他会放出一颗新星。赶快保持距离避开！新星会对你造成大量持续伤害，减伤效果无效。把Boss从新星区域移开，然后继续进行攻击。

Haith和他的随从

在某些血量的百分比，你将会遇到一些熟悉的敌人！注意，在这些出现的时候，偶尔会有随机的小型火法师在远处生成，留心脚下，地上的火会造成伤害！

* **勇士马卡尔德和马维斯·泰尔纳里斯** :  当他们的血量降至75%时，之前你曾经打败过的这两个首领将会出现在战斗中。将他们聚在一起并尽可能快地将他们杀掉。坦克应该将他们聚在一起，并确保不放松嘲讽。法师需要被打断，挥剑者需要从团队背离（小心破晓者！）

这些小兵的关键点在视频中已经非常清楚地呈现出来了...如果马卡尔德在地上放置了一个保护之环，坦克必须把所有的敌人都移出去。否则如你所见，他不仅会治疗自己，还会治疗BOSS！马卡尔德（剑盾）应该是你的重点目标，但两个都需要死。

* **亚弗尼·冰肤和黑暗法师** :  当它们的血量降至50％时，它们将参与战斗。记住，黑暗法师有一个魔法无效的护盾、地雷和各种可打断的致命技能。她是危险的，必须先集中攻击她。和之前一样，坦克把所有敌人聚到一起并把它们背对着团队，而团队则集中攻击小怪并继续进行打断，但是法师一定要先死。

* **大地之心骑士和远射手皮斯娜** :  在它们剩余25%的生命值时，这两个boss会出现。同样，坦克应该聚集它们并将它们背向团队。皮斯娜应该是你的优先目标，但记住要避开她的定向攻击！它们会消耗你的资源！

简要说明：将首领和小怪堆在一起。先解决小怪，放火在两侧，再回到战斗中。不断重复这个过程。确保将首领保持在守护之环之外，需要时打断技能！;)

* **祝你好运

> CHAMPION MARCAULD
> 
> 
> ** ARENA ONE: CHAMPION MARCAULD **
> 
> This boss is pretty straight forward, the tank should keep agro on the boss at all times while blocking the heavy stuff. The group should always remain BEHIND the boss or the will be hit with nasty area of affect abilities. This can be a fairly mobile fight so the tank has to pay close attention to potential repositioning of the boss throughout!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - As simple as it sounds, this heavy attack will knockdown and do HIGH physical damage. The tank needs to be sure to BLOCK this attack. If a dps or healer is hit with this they should try to dodge roll on time to avoid it, or block it and hope they don't take a one shot. This should generally ALWAYS be on the tank. So be sure your taunt does not fall off!
> 
> **Dawnbreaker** - The boss will cast a frontal aoe Dawnbreaker attack, very similar to the player version of it. This will do HUGE damage and apply a knock down. The tank should block this or simply stand out of it but the group(dps and healer) should NOT get hit with this. It can potentially one shot anyone who is not a tank or is unprepared for it. Since this is of course frontal aoe, it stands to reason that the tank must ALWAYS keep the boss turned AWAY from the group!
> 
> **ADDS** - There will be adds spawning in the fight. The first waves spawns with the boss, the second spawns at 75% of the boss's health, and the 3rd at 40%.
> 
> The adds are all different to each other, you will have dual wield types, casters, healers and two handers. These are small adds and easy to kill if they are controlled so the tank should bring them in to where the boss is and cc them in position while the group kill them with aoe (or focus them individually, depends on the group setup and dps output). The healers need to be interrupted to prevent healing and the two handers MUST be blocked if they heavy attack anyone. They hit very hard and can one shot an unsuspecting player!  They also need to be interrupted if they start charging up a circular aoe around them. The burst if it succeeds will do HIGH damage.
> 
> In the last pack you must be extra careful, there is an add with a sword and shield with a flag on his back. THIS MUST be FOCUSED. He has nasty breath aoe attacks and very large hard hitting heavy attacks. The tank needs to grab this asap and the group should prioritize the target at all costs.
> 
> **Circle Of Protection** - The boss will occasionally cast a Circle Of Protection on the floor. It is CRUCIAL that the tank notices this. The circle will buff the boss with resistances and rapidly heal the boss while standing in it, as well as ANY adds. You MUST as the tank, keep the boss OUT of this circle at all times otherwise it is going it be an extremely long fight!
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Keep the boss still, turned away from the group. Pull adds in to where the boss is and focus adds until they are down.  Every time you see a circle of protection, reposition the boss.
> 
> 
> 
> YAVNI FROST-SKIN
> 
> 
> ** ARENA TWO: YAVNI FROST-SKIN & KATTI ICE-TURNER **
> 
> This boss is simple but there are some rather nasty additions to the fight which must be paid attention to. One is ranged and one is melee, so the tank must understand how to manipulate ranged vs agro. Ranged targets will only ever come TO the tank if the ranged target cannot reach them (it will chase until in range). Melee however will always follow very close. SO the trick to this fight is to taunt BOTH bosses, BUT, put the Melee boss as close as possible to the Ranged one. Not the other way around (good tanks know this, new tanks will need practice). Keep them as close as possible to each other and at all costs, keep them faced AWAY from the group.
> 
> The dps/healer players should always stay on the enemies back, not the front! Focus the mage down FIRST she is your main priority!
> 
> **Bonfire** - It is essential that you follow the base mechanics of the arena while on this fight. If you have gotten this far you have already re-lit the bonfire at least twice. If this boss fight goes on for too long the fire WILL go out and you will have to light it again, pay attention to this mechanic else everyone will freeze to death.
> 
> **ADDS** - There are many adds in this fight at around 50% of the combined boss's health bar and again at around 26%, and the tank will have a hard time controlling them all. So people need to first of all not panic! Don't run around like a headless chicken, dodge and block as and when required and stay focused.
> 
> The adds will need to be taken care of so have plenty of aoe down on the ground to help deal with them and focus individuals based on importance and danger of the enemy you are facing.
> 
> Archers are your number 1 priority. The tank needs to chain these in and pin them asap and they must be killed, they have huge damage and can be a real problem if left alive too long.
> 
> Trolls are easy to deal with simply hold them still as a tank and everyone else stay out of their face.
> 
> Melee enemies and casters are general trash so not too bad but the one with the flag on his back MUST be focused. If he heavy attacks players they will die unless they block. So be careful and keep your eyes open!
> 
> **Katti Ice-Turner (Destruction Staff skills)**
> 
> **Ice Root** - She will cast a channeled ability, normally at the tank or whoever has aggro, which needs to be interrupted. If not interrupted she will cast a ground projected aoe and the player affected will take HIGH single hit damage and be rooted in ice. You will have to dodge roll out of this or wait for it to expire. As dps/healers you do NOT want to be hit by this so keep eyes on her at all times and be ready to interrupt her!
> 
> **Ice Wall** - Katti will occasionally cast an ice wall of elements on the ground, this can do high damage over time and also slow you down/immobilize you. This is presented with a large strip type aoe on the ground (much like a charge ability) and should be avoided.
> 
> **Storm** - At low health she will cast a large circular aoe around her dealing high ice damage over time, simply stay out of this until it is over or until she is dead.
> 
> **Yavni Frost-skin (Two Hander Skills)**
> 
> **Heavy attack/uppercut** - This boss is very simple, he hits HARD and has a lot of basic attacks. The main one to avoid is his heavy attack. he will try to uppercut whoever has aggro (should be the tank) This MUST be blocked else you will be thrown into the air and backwards!
> 
> **Cleave** - As well as basic attacks he will cleave occasionally. This is a fast paced frontal aoe attack. This doesn't cause TOO much of a problem damage wise but dps and healers should avoid it if possible. Simply stay out of the bosses face!
> 
> 
> 
> NAK'TAH
> 
> 
> ** ARENA THREE: NAK'TAH & SHILIA **
> 
> This arena is a pain but as described and demonstrated in the video there are of course ways to co-ordinate with your group to make this very simple and almost fool proof when it comes to the poison. The boss however can get a little tricky especially since one of them is ranged and likes to run around and teleport. So the tank and the group must NOT panic and must focus on controlling themselves and the enemy. You can tank them where they spawn but that is VERY risky for when the poison comes up and most will die to it so below if you don't favor the stacking on the spawn point i will explain a safer positioning.
> 
> The tank should try to taunt both bosses and run towards the east spawn area. This will put the ranged boss on the corner. Once the boss is there, walk back IN again and hold it there while stacking the melee on top of it. This corner is SAFE from all large poison bursts in the room (so no poison one shots!).
> 
> The group should focus down the Mage/caster boss FIRST. The melee is very easy to position, the mage is tricky.
> 
> **Stranglers** - The 4 corners of the room have stranglers and during the fight they will pull people across the room to their position. If you are pulled during a poison burst and you go THROUGH the poison in transit, you will die. SO, it is a lot easier if a dps goes around and kills these stranglers as and when they appear. They don't have a lot of health so shouldn't be too difficult to dispatch. Leaving them alive however can be a mess, so be careful, and remember the lines between the corners to avoid the poison. There are safe spots as explained in the video!
> 
> **ADDS!** - At around 53% there will be adds spawning in the room. These can get tricky so be sure you have plenty of AOE down on the ground. They don't have a lot of health but they can overwhelm you if you are not careful.
> 
> The wizards need to be chained in and interrupted while they are alive else they will put massive aoes on the floor and your group will have a hard time surviving.
> 
> Nerids need to be focused asap! They are your priority targets!
> 
> **Wamasu** - The wamasu will spawn at between 40-45% health of the boss's combined hp. You MUST focus this down. The tank should bring it into the group and turn it away. All dps/healers should stay behind it at all times. It has a frontal aoe and nasty shock damage attacks so kill this as soon as possible regardless of the other enemies in the room. If this stays alive for too long you will have problems.
> 
> **Nak'Tah (Storm Calling Skills)**
> 
> **Streak** - This boss is slippery, SOMETIMES, this boss likes to be in the face of people, and will streak away OR streak into melee range. So once positioned, running away is a pain, but when NOT positioned, it can sometimes land where you want it. However, if this happens, the group MUST stand behind it. A BIG attack is coming and only the tank should try to stand in it...
> 
> **Overload!** - As you may have guessed this boss is a sorcerer, and it has sorcerer abilities. IF the boss gets close it will decide sometimes to cast Overload! It will emit a HUGE widespread cone channeling high lightning damage while the effect is active. The tank can stand and block this, all dps/healers should stay OUT of this or pretty much die.
> 
> **Lightning Form** - Just like the sorcerer class, this boss can go into a lightning form. Resistance is up and also standing TOO close will make you take shock damage each second. You can still reach with melee while standing outside of this aoe as it is quite small, but you do not want to stand inside of it for long periods of time.
> 
> **Liquid Lightning** - The boss will cast a mid sized circular aoe on the ground which does lightning damage over time, do NOT stand in this.
> 
> **Shilia (Duel Wield Skills)**
> 
> **Cripple** - This boss will cast/channel for a couple of seconds and requires an interrupt. failure to interrupt will cripple a player stunning them to the ground (they will have to break free) and applying a bleed damage over time to them. Interrupt this mechanic and it wont be a problem!
> 
> **Spin to win!** - The boss will occasionally cast steel tornado (spin hitting all targets in aoe). While it looks dangerous, he really doesn't hit that hard. you can block it, or heal through it.
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Stay together, hold both bosses together, interrupt when required, focus adds especially the wamasu, and if required send someone out to kill the stranglers. Tank holds stuff turned away, dps hits stuff in the back. Hug the corner so you don't get poison aoe'd to death (safe spot).
> 
> 
> 
> EARTHEN HEART KNIGHT
> 
> 
> ** ARENA FOUR: EARTHEN HEART KNIGHT **
> 
> This boss can either be a piece of cake, or a hot mess. It purely depends on your group's ability to understand the mechanics and coordinate. The tank should of course taunt and hold the boss as still as possible at all times while turning the boss away from the group, BUT this is a fairly mobile fight if you want to be safe and efficient. So the tank will have to reposition the boss occasionally depending on what is happening in the room. Relax and focus, and don't drop the boss!
> 
> **House Dres Enslaver**  - These are KEY! They will put a white beam on a player of their choice. The beam will do HIGH damage over time so healing will be required. After the beam has finished it will pop and an Enslaver Shadow will appear at the feet of the player affected.
> 
> The trick to this is control. IF you are a player that has a beam on them, run ot the edge of the map (wall corner whatever) and wait out the beam. Once it is finished, dodge roll and get back to the group. THIS deliberately PLACES the shadows around the edges keeping them OFF the group.
> 
> Each House Dres Enslaver should be killed. This is where the tank comes in. If the tank simply stacks the boss on them. They can be killed with AOE. failing that, if it is not convenient, kill the add, then go back to the boss. This will be fairly fast paced though so you must pay attention.
> 
> NOTE: The Enslaver drops a Shadow after the beam finishes (placement is key) but if you KILL it before the beam is over, it will drop it where you are, and that COULD be in the group. CAREFUL!
> 
> **Enslaver Shadow**  - These are what spawn from the beams. They spin a sword around violently on repeat in a circular aoe. If you are caught in this you can die in as little as two ticks of damage. So when you drop these off at the sides you MUST get out of their way fast, do NOT stand in the aoe, and if these get dropped in the group, stay away!
> 
> Do not bother trying to kill these, they have high health and you will get overwhelmed by the time you have killed them. So simply, drop them off at the edges and ignore them. Watch your feet.
> 
> **ADDS**  - These spawn at around 70% and 30%, they are minor annoyances. A mage and a kwama type each time. They generally die pretty fast to aoe damage but be sure to kill them as soon as you see them so they don't cause too many complications.
> 
> **Fossilize**  - The boss of course is a Dragonknight and has Dragonknight abilities from the earthen heart skill line. One of which is fossilize. The boss will pick one random target and incase them in stone. This can be dodge rolled, but if caught, simply break free.
> 
> **Eruption**  - The boss will cast a small circular aoe on the ground which will do flame damage over time for a short time. Unlike the player variation of it, this does NOT last 18 seconds. It is fairly fast. Simply stay out of it.
> 
> **Igneous shield**  - The boss will occasionally put on a damage shield, simply keep damaging the boss to break it, or wait until it has run out. Nothing stressful here really.
> 
> **BASH**  - The boss will attack with a massive spinning bash at the tank (or whoever has agro, should be the tank ) Simply block this attack. If you fail you will be knocked down and take high damage. Also getting knocked back here is very risky based on all of the aoe in the room you could be thrown into. So be sure to NOT miss the block!
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Tank stacks the boss on the Enslavers. Enslaver beamed players should move to the edges and drop off shadows (do not bother killing shadows). Priority is Enslaver kill first, boss kill second.
> 
> 
> 
> ANAL'A TU'WHA
> 
> 
> ** ARENA FIVE: ANAL'A TU'WHA **
> 
> This boss is simple but does involve a little repositioning if you want to be 'safe'. The tank should hold the boss where he spawns, turn it away from the group and the group should stay behind the boss at all times and watch for aoes.
> 
> **Shadowcasters** - There are TWO of these in the fight. And this is why the tank will need to reposition the boss. The first one is upon the start of the fight. So keep the boss still and focus this down while doing aoe to the boss at the same time. The shadow caster must be killed asap as explained and demonstrated in the video. If you don't kill it in time and people get cursed...you must ALL individually find one glowing plate and stand on it to cleanse before you explode and die.
> 
> The second shadow cast appears on the west door of the arena at around 40% health of the boss and must also be focused. So simple kill the first one, and then move the boss to the other door for the rest of the fight.
> 
> **ADDS!** - The adds will spawn at health percentages of the boss's health. The first wave is at 100% (shadowcaster and a gargoyle) remember as a tank you MUST turn the gargoyles away from the group and block their heavy attacks. Also the gargoyle will slam the ground, when this happens, get out of the aoe until it is over and then come back in again. Pretty easy to see.
> 
> The second wave is at around 78%, there will be an assassin, a two hander, a scorpion and a gargoyle. Simply stack these on the boss and kill them with aoe. Just be careful again to not get heavy attacked or stand in front of the gargoyle as a dps/healer, and watch for the two hander heavy attacking the group.
> 
> The third add wave is actually a close by piromancer. While a lone add, this can hit incredibly hard. The tank needs to chain this in asap! If it gets a chance to channel,, you must interrupt it. If you fail, he will cast a straight line of flames across the floor and depending on resists and such can actually hit a dps with a one shot. So careful!
> 
> **BANNER!** - The boss will drop a Dragonknight standard on the ground. inside this you will take MASSIVE flame damage over time, at all costs, do NOT stand in this!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is very straight forward. The boss will uppercut the tank (or whoever has aggro). Be sure to block this or you will get knocked back and take HIGH damage.
> 
> **Aura/Volatile Armour** - The boss has a buff which surrounds him in a negative aura/aoe. Be sure to not touch this for prolonged periods od time. It does HIGH damage over time and will kill a dps/healer quickly. So while doing damage watch your distance. Melee can still reach from outside of it.
> 
> **Breath** - The boss is obviously a Dragonknight and has all that comes with it, he can breath fire! This is a cone area of effect attack and all players caught in it will take damage over time flame damage. Be sure to keep the heals coming in case this happens, but generally if you are not in the boss's face you should be fine.
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Tank the boss on the spot and kill the Shadowcaster and adds at the beginning. Once the shadow caster is down take the boss to the west door (or before 40% health) and kill the other shadow caster. KILL the boss while dealing with adds and stay out of the aoe. very simple fight for the most part.
> 
> 
> 
> PISHNA LONGSHOT
> 
> 
> **ARENA SIX: PISHNA LONGSHOT **
> 
> This boss is a lot simpler than it looks but you MUST pay attention to her animations. The tank should hold the boss where she spawns and the group should be in a formation that gives plenty of space. Everyone needs their OWN place to stand in far away from everyone else ( a solid triangle formation for the healer and dps). If you are stacked you CANNOT tell who she is going to attack, spread out! It doesn't matter if you are melee or ranged, what DOES matter is that you do not stack. This is clearly demonstrated in the video. Formation is key.
> 
> **Draining shot!** - This is the primary reason you MUST stay out of your group member's faces. If you are in a triangluar formation, (dps and healers) you can CLEARLY see which person she is aiming at. She will pick a target at random and wind up a long channeled shot. If you are the player targeted, you must do a well timed dodge roll to avoid it. Failure to avoid it will do MASSIVE damage and completely drain your resources. If you stack, it is impossible to see who has this on them and people WILL die! Formation, focus, see the mechanic and react!. Do NOT run away, if this series should have taught you anything by now it is that in THIS game, running does NOT save you.
> 
> **Arrow Spray** - This is a very simple long ranged cone aoe attack. If you see the telegraph for this simply step to one side to avoid it. Like many archers in the game this ability can be avoided with little effort but if caught in it you will take HIGH damage over time.
> 
> **ADDS** - Adds will spawn at health percentages starting with the original spawn at 100%, the second wave is at around the 70% mark, and wave 3 is at 40%.
> 
> These adds are enemies you have seen already but you will be facing archers, werewolves, lurchers and sprigains. Each one should be brought into the gorup and will for the most part die with aoe, but you should primary the lurcher since he is the roughest of the bunch. Be warned however, do NOT dnace around the room. If you do not position these well, they will be spread out and this is when things get messy. Spread out kills are bad! The enemies drop a green circle on the floor, these circles replenish stamina per tick but also do MASSIVE damage. If they are all over the room they are hard to avoid. If they are all in one place they are easier to avoid. So control the adds and watch your feet, remember though, at all times keep eyes on the boss and keep your formation!
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: keep the boss in the middle, have a clean formation. Dodge roll if you have a shot aimed at you and kill the adds close to the boss controlled. DO NOT run around like a **headless chicken.**
> 
> 
> 
> DARK MAGE
> 
> 
> ** ARENA SEVEN: DARK MAGE & SHADOW KNIGHT **
> 
> These bosses are two things, very simple, and a NIGHTMARE! This is all about group coordination and understanding of basic mechanics. The Tank should try to stack the knight on the mage at all times and keep a REALLY close eye on what they are doing. This fight requires a LOT of interrupts! Do NOT drop taunt!
> 
> **Sacrifices** - You have seen these already in this arena but now it is even MORE important to pay attention to them. North , west and east areas will have sacrifices appearing (two regular and one armored one). These MUST be primaried asap. If they are not killed before they get to the shrines, they will summon huge Daedra and you will have to fight them as well as the bosses. We are talking spider Daedra, Daedroths and all manner of nastiness. Kill the sacrifices!
> 
> The first sacrifices will spawn at the beginning of the fight, so focus them asap. The next waves will be at 70%, 50%, and again at between 15-18% health of the total boss health bar.
> 
> **ADDS** - You will get adds in the room at health percentages of the full boss health bar during the fight. Around the 70% health area you will get a Daedroth. he must be dealt with asap because he has some NASTY knock backs, stuns, and breath attacks. He should be brought into the fight with the bosses, turned away from the group and killed asap.
> 
> Also at 25%you will get a Clanfear and 2 Dremora in the room (one caster one sword and board) their attacks are nasty so if they heavy attack/cast/jump at you, you must block. The tank should pull these into the boss fight. At this stage they should be fairly easy to dispatch with aoe BUT if you are struggling, focus them down and get them out of the way fast.
> 
> **Dark Mage (Dark Magic Skills)**
> 
> **Negate bubble** - The boss has a negate bubble and it is NOT friendly! Stay OUT of this at all costs. It will stun people, negate magic users from using their abilities, do damage over time and basically wipe the group if you stay in it.
> 
> Be sure to save your ultimates until AFTER this has gone else your ultimates will be negated/removed.
> 
> **Crystal Shard** - The boss will channel a hard cast Crystal shard! This hits incredibly hard, knocks down, and can borderline one shot a dps/healer. This is focused on a random target and MUST be interrupted!
> 
> **Daedric Mines** - The boss will surround herself in Daedric Mines. If you stand in them they will explode, and stun you. Try not to stand in them. BUT, if a tank has mist form on, they can run around the boss in one swift circle and make them all pop (removing the problem).
> 
> **Magic Bomb** - The boss will channel an ability with her staff in the air and when finished will cast a massive magicka damage based bomb that will land on the ground and explode in large area of effect. This MUST be interrupted!
> 
> **Burst/Explosion** - The boss will levitate and channel up an ability which if successful will burst in aoe damage. This MUST be interrupted!
> 
> **Shadow Knight (Dawn's wrath skills)**
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is a very simple visual, a heavy attack will be wound up at the tank (or whoever has agro) simply block this to prevent huge damage and knock back.
> 
> **NOVA!** - This must be avoided at all costs! Not only does the dark mage have a negate bubble but this guy has a Nova! If he places this, get OUT of it as soon as possible, it does MASSIVE damage.
> 
> **Vampire's bane/Reflected Light** - The boss will cast a single target damage over time on players which will do high damage. This needs to be healed through or purified/cleansed.
> 
> **Purifying light** - The boss will cast purifying light on a player stacking up damage over time to pop in a burst of damage after 6 seconds, just like the Templar ability players have. Once it has popped it will leave a heal on the ground for the boss to heal with. Keep him away from whatever target has this effect on them if possible so he doesn't heal.
> 
> **Dark Flare** - The boss will channel and cast a single target shot at a player of his choice. Interrupt this to avoid it from happening.
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Always primary the sacrifices as soon as they are spawned. Focus the Mage and make sure you interrupt EVERYTHING! After the mage is dead, focus down the Knight while avoiding nova and killing adds. The fight is a lot easier once the mage is dead!
> 
> 
> 
> MAVUS TALNARITH
> 
> 
> ** ARENA EIGHT: MAVUS TALNARITH **
> 
> This boss is a lot simpler than it looks and it is all about pace. However over-nuking or lack of care and attention can result in a very fast WIPE. The tank needs to taunt and hold the boss still at all times and the group needs to spread out and find their OWN space.
> 
> **Ice Comet/Meteor** - The boss will pick a random target and fire a Meteor at them. DO NOT dodge roll, this is why you stay apart, to see who has it on them. When it is in transit you will see a circle of dots at your feet. When you see this, BLOCK! Once it lands, THEN move away from the aoe left over on the floor.
> 
> **Volcanic Rune** - The boss will cast runs on the ground. Do not stand in these. If you do, they will pop, you will be flung in the air and take HUGE flame damage.
> 
> **Fire Trail** - The boss will channel and cast a fire trail across the ground. This will wipe out a dps/healer in one shot if they stand in it, so watch your feet. However this ability CAN be interpreted, so bash/interrupt him asap to avoid this mechanic!
> 
> **ADDS** - The boss does have some basic adds. These should be focused to get them off the field, they have nasty flame and heavy attacks and you do not want to keep them alive while dealing with upcoming mechanics.
> 
> Two mages will spawn with him at 100%, a two hander will spawn at 80%. Be sure to deal with these, they are a BIG problem if they go loose.
> 
> **CENTURIONS!** - This is why you do NOT want to nuke the boss. Two waves of centurions spawn in this fight. One at 80% and one at 40%. If you try to nuke you could be overrun by too much going on at once.
> 
> The red ones will spin at random players, the yellow ones will try to cleave and the blue ones will fire shots in the air which put a curse on two players at random. THIS is where it gets tricky. That mechanic from the blue one MUST be interrupted!
> 
> If you fail to interrupt the blue Centurion, one player will get an ice aoe around them and another a fire aoe around them. These two players must stack on top of each other perfectly as fast as possible and STAY together until the aoes pop.
> 
> Stacked like this they will negate each other's aoe and it will disappear. If you FAIL to do this both players will blow up and die.
> 
> So, interrupt the blue Centurion and this never needs to be a problem!
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Fight the boss till 80% and then kill the Centurions (interrupt the blue one) repeat again at 40%. The rest of the time, stay in formation, spread out and BLOCK Ice Comets. After 40% if all adds are dead, it is just 'kill him!'.

> 
> VAMPIRE LORD THISA
> 
> 
> ** ARENA NINE: VAMPIRE LORD THISA **
> 
> This boss is actually quite simple but does have an unusual mechanic, one you should have seen already before this fight. The tank should grab the boss from her spawn point and hold her near the gate. Turn her away from the group and the rest of the group should always stay behind her while watching their feet!
> 
> **Bat Swarm** - The boss will cast a bat swarm (same as the player ultimate for vampire skill line) It has a HUGE area of affect, only lasts about 5 seconds, but if you are hit you will damage yourself and heal HER. So avoid this at all costs. The more people in the aoe, the more health she gets back.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss will heavy attack the tank (or whoever has aggro) to avoid this simply BLOCK it. If you do not, you will be knocked down.
> 
> **ADDS** - There are skeleton and wrath adds in this fight that must be dealt with. The tank should be sure to taunt and position them at all times and the group needs to kill them as a priority. The wrath specifically must go down fast. It has nasty ice attacks that CAN be interrupted but if not will cause one shots to the dps players and possibly the healer.
> 
> These spawn at the beginning while the boss spawns with 100% health, then again at 40% so keep your eyes open.
> 
> **BANNER!** - The vampire IS a Dragonknight and DOES drop a Dragonknight standard. If this happens, get out asap or die! It does huge damage over time and you do not want to be stuck in it.
> 
> **Jumping Spin Attack** - The boss will occasionally erupt into flames and do a massive jumping spinning attack with her shield at the tank. This can be blocked but is AOE too so others around should also block or be knocked down.
> 
> **Mist Form** - The boss will appear as though she has turned into mist/smoke. During this phase she will do aoe damage to the group and take a MASSIVE reduction to damage. Don't waste all your good stuff while she is mist form, nuke her when she comes out of it instead!
> 
> **Volatile Armour** - Very much like round 5, this boss has a buff that surrounds her with negative damage effects, try not to stand IN the aoe if you can help it. It isn't particularly large in size, but the damage output is high.
> 
> **Rubyn Jonnicent & Zackael Jonnicent** - These two are very hard hitters. The tank needs to grab them ASAP! One is a stam sorc with a two hander so will come in close and must be blocked if he heavy attacks. The other is a mag sorc and does long range crystal shards which must be interrupted or players will take one shots. They cannot be hit for more than '1' damage per attack while their ghosts exist (separate linked entity).
> 
> When these guys are in the room, BOTH dps should jump into one of the pits (the stuff you are meant to avoid with the hands coming out). When this happens the healer and the tank will be left upstairs. The tank needs to position the new adds ready for when the dps come back to the fight, while the healer keeps him/her up.
> 
> Meanwhile down stairs the two dps encounter the ghosts/spirits of the enemies plus a couple of other harder adds. You must kill these, not die and then come through the portal once they are down. The portal will put you back upstairs.
> 
> NOW that the spirits are dead, the adds can be hit for full damage and MUST be focused!
> 
> SIMPLE NOTES: Tank keeps the boss faced away from the groups and brings adds close with her. The group spreads out and stays out of aoe. When the Jonnicents come in, two dps go downstairs to kill ghosts, and come back up to finish the job.
> 
> 
> 
> HIATH THE BATTLEMASTER
> 
> 
> ** ARENA TEN - THE FINAL BOSS: HIATH THE BATTLEMASTER **
> 
> This boss has been talking to you the whole time you have been in VDSA and finally you get to kill him! BUT there are some complicated yet simple at the same time...mechanics. This can go extremely smooth, or horrible wrong. Yes there are many cheese videos out there on how to cheat the mechanics (which lets face it usually end in tears with multiple wipes trying to get it righ...but i am here to EXPLAIN how the actual 'mechanics' are designed and work!
> 
> SO, everyone go to the end of the map where he spawns. There is an open plane type area and the tank should hold him in the MIDDLE of it. while the rest of the croup make a nice semi circle behind him. Everyone needs their own space.
> 
> **FLAMES!** - At beginning of the fight the boss will hit everyone with a flame ball attack. This will emit a flame circle under each player. What you need to do here is ALL go to 4 different safe corners (split up and stand around the edges) and survive. After a few seconds the flame circle will pop, and drop on the floor, revealing a flame Atronach in EACH fire circle. The effect is no longer on you so  get BACK in the middle in order to continue the fight.
> 
> NOTE: This seems to be on a timer (60-75 seconds apart) but above all just notice when it has happened and go PLACE your own aoe out of the way of the group. There are 3 major islands in this arena so use all the islands if you need to (if you get over whelmed.
> 
> **Flame Atronachs** - As noted above, each flaming aoe will spawn an Atronach. The tank should chain these IN to the fight with the main boss and the group should focus them down. They only have 500k hp each so a couple of ultimates should be more than enough of just aoe damage if you are in a high damage group. Relax, don't run away, they are really not as scary as they look!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will vanish for a second and come out of stealth with a heavy attack. This must be blocked
> 
> **Deadly Cloak** - Very similar to deadly cloak, the boss buffs himself with a whirling aoe attached to him. This deals moderate damage to anyone caught inside. Watch your feet, don't stand in it for too long or be sure to have heavy heals during it.
> 
> **Soul Shred** - Just like the Nightblade Ultimate, the boss will stun in area of effect when he jumps into the air. You will need to break free from this before he follows up with other attacks.
> 
> **'LOOK a destraction!'** - The boss sometimes jumps over the tank like a ninja fairy! He has re-positioned, don't panic, just keep a taunt up and get back into formation.
> 
> **Steel Tornado** - As well as his basic attacks he will sometimes throw out the odd steel tornado, hitting everyone within range with physical damage. Don't panic, you can block it, or heal through it.
> 
> **Cripple** - The boss will channel a cripple effect which will stun the chosen target. If this hits you simply break free, but before that you CAN interrupt it to completely avoid it.
> 
> Deep Breath/Suck in mechanic|r - At 50% and 25% the boss will channel for about 3 seconds and do what is usually described as a massive 'suck in' mechanic. He will pull players in close and then straight after EXPLODE in fire. This does HUGE damage so must be blocked/mitigated. After the hit the healer needs to get people back to high health fast before he tries to finish people off with a steel tornado.
> 
> **NOVA!** - At around 40% the boss will throw down a NOVA. Get out of this asap! big damage over time and damage reduction will not help you. Reposition the boss out of the Nova and carry on as normal.
> 
> **Haith's Entourage**
> 
> At health percentages you will meet some familiar faces! Note during these spawns occasionally random Small fire mages can spawn at a distance, watch your feet, the fire across the floor hurts!
> 
> Champion Marcauld & Mavus Talnarith - At 75% these two bosses you have fought before will enter the fight. Stack them together and kill them as fast as you can. The tank should stack them all together and be sure not to drop taunts. The mage will require interrupts and the sword and board will need to be turned AWAY from the group (watch for Dawnbreakers!)
> 
> The key point to these adds was demonstrated very clearly in the video...If Marcauld puts a circle of protection on the ground, the tank must move ALL enemies OUT of it. Else as you clearly saw, he doesn't just heal himself, he heals the BOSS! Marcauld (sword n board) should be your priority target, but both need to die.
> 
> Yavni Frost-Skin & Dark Mage - At 50% heath these two will enter the fight. Remember the Dark Mage has a negate bubble, mines and all manner of nasty interruptible abilities. She is the danger and she MUST be focused down first. Same routine as before, tank stacks everything and turns it all away while the group focuses down the adds and keeps on interrupts, but the mage MUST die.
> 
> Earthen Heart Knight & Pishna Longshot - At 25% health these two bosses will span. Again the tank should stack them on the boss and turn them away from the group. Pishna should be your priority target but remember to avoid her aimed attacks! They drain resources!
> 
> SIMPLE NOTE: Stack the boss and adds. Kill adds, Drop fire on the sides, come back in and continue. Rinse repeat. Keep the boss out of the circle of protection and interrupt when necessary! ;)
> 
> GOOD LUCK OUT THERE!!!
