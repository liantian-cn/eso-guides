## 艾尔登洞穴 I





### 阿卡什·格拉-玛尔

> Akash gra-Mal


* **阿卡什·格拉** : 玛尔 **

这个首领在机制方面非常简单。只要坦克能在需要时格挡，保持嘲讽并让首领背对着团队，一切都应该没问题。治疗和输出应该始终站在首领后面并保持接近。不要像无头鸡一样在房间里乱跑，这样做是没有帮助的。

* **Cleave** :  她会以锥形前方AOE横劈，坦克应该格挡并让她站稳，确保她不能对着团队使用这个攻击。它会击退并使情况变得混乱。

* **旋风** :  偶尔，首领会将武器围绕头部旋转，制造出一个像旋风一样的范围伤害，任何被困在这个小伤害范围内的人都会受到每个周期的伤害。只要呆在范围外，一切都会好起来。没有必要四处奔跑，只要把脚移出范围就行了。坦克如果阻挡可以站在里面，但真的没有必要这样做，只需要持续嘲讽并让她保持静止。顺便提一下，通常这种能力后面会跟着一个重击/升天击，应该使用格挡来避免。

* **跳** :  如果你决定毫无理由地在房间里四处奔跑，一旦有人距离她太远，她会随机跳向玩家并落在他们的头上。不要四处奔跑，靠近她，这个机制就永远不会发生。它旨在维持群体协调，混乱的小组将会遇到问题。





### 远古树精

> Ancient Spriggan


**远古树精**

这个首领实际上并没有什么威胁，甚至因其低伤害和低血量而被认为是可笑的。然而，它仍然是首领，当然我们会详细讨论它。

* **手下小怪** :  进入房间后，你会发现她身边有3个小怪（较小的树精），应该将它们拉到boss上并背对着团队。它们会尝试进行一些基本的轻攻击，偶尔会有治疗，这可以被打断，但是即使是最低的AOE伤害也可以非常快地将它们击败。

在游戏中，偶尔会出现BOSS试图为自己或手下（如果他们存在的话）治疗的情况。这种治疗是一个持续的效果，可以通过她举起双手来轻松地识别，并可以打断以防止她这么做。记住要及时打断技能！**（HEAL为专有名词不翻译）**

除了上述内容，她的普通攻击非常弱，应该背对着团队并立即消灭。一些杂兵敌人可能比这个BOSS更难对付……直到艾尔登洞穴II才会遇到她更加棘手的旋风形态！





### 窒息荆棘

> CHOKETHORN


这是一个攻略标题，其中包含了游戏中的一个专有名词“CHOKETHORN”，它可能表示游戏中的某个敌人或地点。其中的<html>和</html>标签用于格式化显示效果，应该不需要翻译。同时，标题中还有两个图片文件名（xynode_boss_over.dds），它们也不需要翻译，可能表示游戏中的某个图标或角色模型。黄色字体的“CHOKETHORN”可能是一个重要的关键词，需要结合具体攻略内容进行理解。

这个Boss有一些最简单和明显的机制，但在没有专注于它们的团队中可能会变得非常混乱。坦克应该一直嘲讽Boss并把Boss转离团队。然后，团队应该相对分散但靠近Boss地围绕Boss。坦克需要确保在战斗中偶尔出现的重击时阻挡以避免被击倒。

* **藤蔓扯拉** :  这个机制非常简单，如果你离首领太远，它会把你链进来，你会有一秒钟左右的时间不能动，这造成的伤害很小，但很烦人，如果可能的话应该避免。这个机制之后是爆发性AOE机制，会带来麻烦，所以不要四处奔波，除非机制要求你移动，要保持离首领近一点。

* **爆裂** :  Chorkthorn 会在几秒钟内将他的头埋入地面，一个非常大的范围伤害会从房间中心扩散开来。这是你留意的机会，赶紧离开范围。一旦它结束，就再次尽快靠近。这是一个非常高的伤害技能，非阻挡、非护盾的 dps 或治疗者，这会让你失去大约 90% 的最大生命值，而且如果不幸的话，还可能秒杀人。

简单的机制，当它扩散时离开，当它消失时回来。如果你是被困在里面的坦克，死亡的几率很低，但一定会被击倒。

* **治疗蛇藤** :  整场战斗中会有一些小的蛇藤在房间中一直为首领提供治疗，恢复少量生命值。这些蛇藤可以被打断或击杀，但请确保在击杀一个蛇藤后重新站好位置，以防止首领用藤蔓将你拉回去。如果你的团队 DPS 不够高，无法击杀或打断这些蛇藤，那么它们会不断地增加治疗量，让你很难击败首领。所以请确保优先攻击这些目标。





### 奈内什·格罗－玛尔

> Nenesh gro-Mal


** 奈内什·格罗－玛尔 **

这个BOSS有时很难被发现，在一个大群敌人中有多个近战，远程和治疗类型。坦克应该首先寻找这个家伙，并将他固定在原地并背对着群体。然后在控制BOSS的同时，尝试把尽可能多的其他敌人拉到他身上，以便让团队进行AOE伤害。不要在房间里四处奔跑，让坦克在目标失控之前控制它们。

* **重攻击** :  一个简单的升天击，应该用盾格挡，否则你会被击倒。即使是输出职业也可以格挡，因为它的伤害很小。

* **闪电形态** :  就像巫师的玩家技能一样，他可以变成闪电形态，过于接近他会每秒造成电击伤害，但伤害非常小。这不应该引起太多问题。

* **爆裂法师之怒** :  这是一种聚能攻击，会在一个小范围内爆发闪电。它的伤害很小，但可以被打断。所以如果团队打断反应很快，这个机制就不是问题了。

Hollow: 空心人

这个首领是地牢中阿利特族小弟的大哥。一只巨大的恐龙般的首领，机制很简单。他有一个伙伴和他在一起，坦克应该嘲讽普通的阿利特族和首领，并将它们一起面向团队保持在一起。团队应该始终呆在首领后面。

* **咬** :  这是一种非常微弱的攻击，坦克即使不阻挡也能承受得住，但如果太多攻击袭击DPS或治疗师，则可能会出现问题。保持BOSS面向团队中的坦克，防止任何人被咬。

* **跳跃** :  就像这种敌人的其他敌人一样，他会跳起来，猛烈地撞向他已经引起仇恨的目标（希望是坦克）。这基本上是他的重击，必须进行格挡。一个坦克、输出或治疗者可以通过简单的格挡来生存下来，但如果不进行格挡，它可能会造成相当多的伤害并将其击倒。请确保坦克在这个机制期间进行嘲讽和格挡以避免任何问题。然而，如果BOSS在DPS或治疗者身上释放，则他们应该进行格挡并不要四处奔跑。没有必要奔跑。

* **呼吸与咬** :  这是一个吸气动画，然后是一次相当可怕的咬。这应该面向坦克，不要让首领转身，因为它是一个锥形AOE，可以攻击多个人。这可以被格挡，而且，在施法时，你实际上可以迈出一步然后再回来。





### 奥兰内斯族长

> Canonreeve Oraneth


**奥兰内斯族长**

这个地城的最终BOSS可能会非常具有挑战性。她的血量很高，如果人们不注意就会造成很多伤害。她可以被嘲讽并被固定在原地，但是很多机制会单独瞄准小组的其他成员，所以协调是关键。你的坦克应该把BOSS固定在房间中央，其他小组成员应该站在三角形的形状中，拥有自己的空间，就像在拼搭地牢中与耳语者战斗时那样。不要在房间里四处奔跑。找到自己的位置，在必须移动的时候才移动。

* **霜冻** :  很像闪电形态（但没有视觉效果），她会释放一种霜冻技能，在非常靠近她的人身上造成非常小的持续伤害，这种伤害虽然很弱，但代表着她下一个机制即将到来（毒箭）。

* **毒箭** :  这就是你必须保持队形的原因。虽然坦克可以全程嘲讽住他，但这个机制是随机的，她会向任何她想要的人释放。她会转过身来，面向她选择的目标，引导一个技能并向该玩家释放毒箭。如果是你成为了目标，你需要在她释放时进行闪避翻滚。这样做意味着你完全避免了伤害。但如果你错过了时机，你将被箭击中，承受大量的伤害，同时还会有小的持续伤害效果。如果DPS或者治疗类型的角色不注意的话，这可能会造成致命的后果。

一旦你避开了机制，尽快回到原位。不要在房间里四处奔跑。

* **眩晕** :  这是一个非常容易识别的机制，她会在她选择的玩家周围或附近放置一个相当小的范围攻击。地面上会伸出手来拉住玩家，使其无法移动。这个机制的简单解决方法是"不要站在它里面"。

* **骷髅** :  另一个类似于上述小范围AOE，但这个会召唤4个骷髅敌人。应该使用AOE攻击快速击败它们，坦克应该尝试抓住它们并将它们和BOSS放在一起（使用链式技能、远程嘲讽，不要四处乱跑）。如果这些敌人得到控制，就不会造成太大的问题，但是如果你四处乱跑，你会分散团队对于其它机制的注意力，有可能会导致全灭。保持协调，不要惊慌。如果它们攻击你，就格挡，直到坦克能够抓住它们，或者尽快将它们击败，这取决于你的小组。它们的重击非常强力，需小心防范。

* **爆炸** :  这个明显巨大的范围攻击非常简单。要么躲开它，要么死亡。当你看到它扩散时，向后移动直到躲开它，然后当它消失后再回去。如果坦克足够厚实，可以承受伤害，但会被击退。DPS或治疗者会在一击之下死亡。

注意力要集中，等机会一过，马上回到你指定的位置。再次乱跑只会让情况变得更混乱，所以找到你的位置，只有必要时才移动，然后回到原先的位置。

> This boss is very simple as far as mechanics go. So long as the tank can block when required to, hold a taunt and keep the boss facing AWAY from the group, everything should be fine. Healers and dps should stand behind the boss at all times and stay close. DO NOT run around the room like a headless chicken it will not help.
> 
> **Cleave** - She will cleave in a frontal AOE in the shape of a cone, the tank should block this and hold her still making sure she does NOT face the group with this attack. It knocks back and can make things messy.
> 
> **Whirlwind** - Occasionally the boss will spin her weapon around her head making a whirlwind like AOE and anyone caught in this small damage circle will take damage per tick. Simply stay out of the circle and everything will be fine. No need for sprinting around, just get your feet out of it. The tank can stand in it if blocking but there is really no need, simply hold a taunt and keep her still. This ability by the way is usually followed by a heavy attack/uppercut which can and SHOULD be blocked.
> 
> **Jump** - IF you decide to start running around the room for no good reason, once someone gets too far from her she will randomly JUMP at players and land on their head. Do not run around, stay close to her and this mechanic will never happen. It is designed to keep up group co-ordination, and messy groups will have a problem with her.

> This boss is not really of any threat what so ever and is funny to be even considered as a boss due to its low damage and low health, however it is one none the less and of course we will go over it.
> 
> **Minions** - As you enter the room you will notice that she will have 3 minions with her (smaller spriggans) these should be pulled together on top of the boss and turned away from the group. There are a few basic light attacks that they attempt to pull off and the odd heal which can be interrupted, however these can be killed VERY fast with even the lowest AOE damage.
> 
> **HEAL** - She will occasionally try to heal her self or her minions (if they last that long) and this is a channeled effect which is easily spotted by her raising her hands and can be interrupted to prevent her from doing so.
> 
> Apart from the above she has very weak light attacks, should be turned away from the group and burnt down on the spot. Some of the trash enemies can be considered harder than this boss...Until Elden Hollow II that is when we meet the darker version of her!

> This boss has some of the simplest and obvious mechanics but can be SO messy in groups that do not focus on them. The tank should be taunting the boss at all times and turn the boss away from the group. The group should then circle fairly spread neatly around the boss but CLOSE to it. The tank needs to make sure that he/she blocks the heavy attacks which come occasionally during the fight to avoid being knocked down.
> 
> **Vine pull** - This Mechanic is very simple, IF you are too far away from the boss, it will chain you in and you are somewhat stuck for a second or so, this does minimal damage but is a pain and should be avoid if possible. This followed by the burst AOE mechanic can be a problem so do NOT run around the room, stay close unless mechanics mean you have to move.
> 
> **Burst** - very few seconds Chorkthorn will bury his head in the ground and a very large AOE will spread from the center of the room. This is your time to pay attention and get OUT of it. As soon as it is over, get back in close again. This is a very high damage ability and to a NON blocking NON shielded dps or healer, this will take around 90% of your max health from you and if unlucky can one shot people as well.
> 
> Simple mechanics, get out when it spreads, get back in when it is gone. If you are a tank caught in this, there is a low chance of dying but it WILL knock you down.
> 
> **Healing Stranglers** - Throughout the fight small stranglers will spawn around the room and attach a healing beam to the boss, healing for small amounts. These can be either interrupted or killed, but be sure to get back in position once you kill one to prevent the boss pulling you in with vines. With a LOW dps group if you don't kill them or stay on interrupts then you can get overwhelmed with these and it becomes very hard to kill the boss due to the amount of stacking heals. So be sure to prioritize these targets.

> This boss is sometimes hard to see, he is in a LARGE group of enemies with multiple melee, ranged and healer types. The tank should look for this guy first off and hold him on the spot facing away from the group. Then while holding the boss, try to pull in as many of the others as possible on top of him in order for the group to AOE damage the adds. DO NOT run around the room, let the tank control the targets before they get out of hand.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - A simple uppercut which should be blocked or else you will get knocked down. This is fine for even a dps to block as it does barely any damage.
> 
> **Lightning Form** - Just like the sorcerer player ability, he is in the form of lightning and standing too close to him will zap players every second with shock damage, but the damage is VERY small. This shouldn't cause much of a problem.
> 
> **Burst/mages fury** - This is a channeled attack which bursts lightning once in a small AOE. It does minimal damage BUT it can be interrupted. So if the team is on point with interrupts, this mechanic will not be a problem at all.

> This boss is the big brother of the Alits in the dungeon. A big dinosaur looking boss with some very simple mechanics. He has one friend with him and the tank should taunt both the regular Alit and the boss and simply hold them together facing away from the group. The group should stay behind the boss at all times.
> 
> **Bite** - An extremely weak attack which the tank can withstand without even blocking however can be problematic if too many hit a dps or healer, keep the boss turned away from the group and on the tank to prevent anyone from being bitten.
> 
> **Jump** - Just like the other enemies of this kind, he will JUMP in the air and slam onto the target he has agro too (hopefully the tank). This is basically his heavy attack and MUST be blocked. A tank, dps or healer will live through this with a simple block BUT if not blocked it can do quite a lot of damage and knock down. Be sure the tank is taunting and blocking during this mechanic to save any issues. IF the boss is loose on a dps or healer however they should BLOCK and NOT run around the room. No need to run.
> 
> **Breath and bite** - This is a breathe IN animation followed by a pretty nasty bite. This should be kept facing the tank, do NOT spin the boss around because it is a cone shaped AOE and can hit more than one person. This can be blocked but also, while it is casting you can actually just step out of it and then once it is over, step back in again.

> The final boss in this dungeon can be quite challenging. She has a lot of health and does a LOT of damage if people don't pay attention. She can be taunted and held on the spot but a lot of mechanics will individually target other members of the group so co-ordination is key. You tank should hold the boss in the center of the room and your remaining group members should stand in a triangle formation having their OWN space just like in Spindleclucth fighting the whisperer. Do NOT run around the room. Find your spot and only move from it when you HAVE to.
> 
> **Frost** - Very much like lightning form (but without the visual) she will spawn a frost ability which will do very small damage over time to people very close to her, this is weak but indicates her next mechanic is coming (the poison bolt).
> 
> **Poison Bolt** - This s the reason you must stay in formation. Although the tank can hold a taunt on her for the whole fight, THIS mechanic is random and she will cast it on whoever she wants. She will physically turn and face the target she has chosen, wind up a channeled ability and fire a poison bolt at the player. If this is YOU, you NEED to dodge roll as she casts it. Doing so will mean you completely avoid the damage. BUT if you miss time it you will be hit with the bolt and take a LOT of damage along side having a small damage over time on you also. This can kill most dps/healer types if they are not paying attention.
> 
> Once you have dodged the mechanic, get back in position ASAP. Don't sprint around the room.
> 
> **Stun** - This is a very easy to spot mechanic, she will place a rather small AOE on the ground on a player of her choice, or NEAR a player. Hands will come out of the ground and pull the player in to the hole stunning them in place. The simple resolve to this mechanic is 'don't stand in it'.
> 
> **Skeletons** - Another small AOE similar to the one above but this one actually spawns 4x skeleton enemies. These should be killed quickly with AOE damage and the tank should try to grab them and put them with the boss (chains,range taunts, don't run around the room). These if controlled will not cause much of a problem BUT if you run around the room panicking you are going to distract the group from the rest of the mechanics and risk wiping everyone out. Keep co-ordinated and don't panic. If they are on you, just block until the tank can grab them, or kill them fast, whichever works best for your group. They do heavy attack though so look out for those.
> 
> **BLAST** - This HUGE obvious growing AOE is very simple. Get out of it or die. When you see it spreading, move backwards until you are out of it, and then when it is gone get back in again. A tank can withstand the damage if they are chunky enough but will get knocked back. A dps or healer will die in one shot.
> 
> Pay attention and once it is gone, get back into your assigned position. Again running around is going to make things a MESS, so find your spot and only move when you have to, then get back where you were.
