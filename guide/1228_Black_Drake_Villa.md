### 哨兵阿克萨拉兹

> SENTINEL AKSALAZ


**哨兵阿克萨拉兹 (超级秘密BOSS) |cffff00**

这个boss是超级秘密的boss，只有在你完成了所有秘密的boss之后才能激活！

这个常规版本的首领需要在此之前击败3个秘密首领。这个首领的困难模式版本需要在此之前击败所有秘密首领和所有的困难模式！

每个人必须在副本结束时拥有25个[Wisps]，并将它们存入最后BOSS房间后面的雕像中，或者整个小组合计100个。激活雕像后，[Kinras Ironeye]将出现。

最后一个转折。如果你失败了这个boss 5次......他将会消失。注意观察，不要让他逃掉！

这个Boss需要尽可能保持静止以减少混乱，坦克需要时刻将其转向远离队伍！它攻击非常强，所以要带上治疗！

* **重击** :  想象一下你曾经见过的所有重击，然后将它们全部结合在一起。格挡它，否则你将被传送到死亡堆里！

在困难模式下，这会对被攻击目标造成巨大的持续伤害效果，你必须带来强大的治疗才能抵抗。

* **冰通道尖刺** : 老板会把他的剑插入地面并释放冰元素Aoe，会在每个玩家下方生成。注意躲避，以免这些AOE在你下面爆炸。每个玩家将有3个这样的AOE在他们的下方出现，然后老板将停止放置。如果你被击中，基本上就会死亡，所以请小心。

在困难模式中，这个技能会对被攻击的目标造成很大的持续伤害效果，你必须为此提供强大的治疗。

* **冰霜挥舞** :  这是一个前方、多次攻击、移动AOE技能，所以除了坦克之外，任何人都不应该在附近！

在困难模式下，此技能可以对目标造成巨大的持续伤害效果，你必须为此带来强大的治疗。

* **霜魔虫魔** :  它们一个接一个进入房间（在困难模式下，每次两只）并且必须被视为您的主要目标。让它们留在房间里杀人是愚蠢的。消灭它们。这个boss没有“DPS检测”，所以打boss的时间可以任意延长，但你必须消灭小兵。

* **冰彗星** :  随机的玩家身上将有一个巨大的范围AOE。当它达到最大范围时，一颗冰彗星会落在他们的头上。这必须在一个安全的地方用格挡来避免，并且不能与其他玩家叠加。在整个战斗中，越来越多的玩家将会同时收到这些攻击，它们绝不能重叠。

当血量低于25%时，处于困难模式下，4名玩家每阶段将拥有一个冰彗星，留意你的脚下，每个人都必须格挡自己的彗星，没人应该重叠。

* **秘密Boss** :  之前你在地牢中打斗的Boss现在出来玩了！他们会像之前一样拥有全部的机制，但现在你必须和其他的所有东西在同一个房间内应对。这很简单，坦克需要吸引并控制小Boss和主Boss，并始终将他们的面向转向远离你。

每个Boss的出现时间取决于你杀死前一个Boss的速度（如果你攻击过猛，有可能它还在执行某些机制）。

游戏

第一个Boss将在85％时出现。

游戏
第二个Boss将在60%时出现。

最后的Boss将在剩余血量35%时出现。

你的主要注意力仍然应该放在房间里的小鬼上，但是如果没有小鬼，你必须把注意力集中在副本中的小首领上，而不是主首领。你不想一下子就把主首领打爆了，却有两个小首领在房间里。

把它简单化，别做蠢事。

* **旋风** :  首领会在房间内释放旋风，顺时针旋转，你需要贴着边缘并且避开它们。与此同时，房间的中心会爆炸冰块，所以你不能待在那里。

寻找一个缺口，在圆圈里跑一圈，等结束后再返回！

注意：作为坦克，确保保持嘲讽。大多数团队在这里失败是因为当战斗结束时boss逃脱了。集中注意力！

* **没有位置了（执行阶段）** :  在25%以下是“执行”阶段。基本上规则相同，没有种族......你不必让这个阶段变得快速，保持你的机制干净并且不要着急。即使你的DPS降到了1k，只要你不死，你仍然可以杀死boss！

基本上房间外部覆盖着冰，整个房间除了中间很小的部分之外都是禁止区域。在这里他将继续进行基本机制。冰彗星、恶魔、冰通道/尖刺等所有内容都是一样的，但空间有限。

同时，你不仅会受到boss的正面范围攻击，还会不断地从两侧飞来，你必须注意脚下并找到空隙躲避。

在这里，你要重复使用机制直到敌人死亡。无论需要多长时间都可以！

提示：在困难模式下的最后，你将面对4个冰陨石。你不能叠在一起，必须快速找到一个角落躲避（视频演示），合理使用格挡，然后像平常一样继续战斗。注意，小鬼仍然比首领更优先被击败。

这是一篇"Elder Scrolls Online"游戏攻略。

1. 开始任务后，你将与维格会面。他将指引你前往扎城。
2. 在扎城，你将需要会见恩先生。他会告诉你前往金拉斯·铁眼手下咆哮的营地。
3. 在那里，使用时间静止技能并消灭咆哮和他的部队。
4. 接下来你需要分别与维格和活力之石合作，把队长杰米诺斯和哨兵阿克萨拉兹从哨兵城救出来。
5. 在阿蒂的办公室，她被派罗图格·恩克拉迪斯控制了。你需要消灭他并救出阿蒂。
6. 然后你需要前往侍灵之地并消灭阿克和他的龙。
7. 最终你需要前往血根熔炉并消灭维拉和她的随从。
8. 祝你好运！





### Black Drake Villa的翻译为“黑龙别墅”。

> AVATAR OF ZAL


* **攻略翻译
 扎的化身** : （秘密Boss）**

正如视频所示，每个玩家都必须站在压力垫上才能打开陷阱门。一旦激活，你可以走下楼梯，激活雕像并召唤Boss。

这个BOSS非常简单，只需要确保坦克始终保持嘲讽并将BOSS从小队里面转移出去即可，无论发生什么情况。

* **精神爆炸** :  BOSS 偶尔会站立起来，在身前释放一个类似于精神爆炸的技能。这个技能会重复地攻击 BOSS 前面的每一个玩家，如果击中一个 dps/治疗玩家会造成非常大的伤害。你需要确保 BOSS 背对着团队，或者当这种情况发生时团队故意站在 BOSS 的背后。

* **幽灵鹿宝宝** :  这个Boss 偶尔会施放震晕效果，看起来像是3只幽灵驯鹿同时向前冲。这应该对着坦克释放，如果不幸对着DPS/治疗释放，他们必须进行格挡，否则将被击倒并受到高伤害。同时激活前两个机制可能会很快变得混乱，所以请确保Boss面对着坦克而不是小组。

* **攻略翻译
瞬移** :  为了让你始终保持警觉，首领会在房间内不停地瞬移。当它瞬移的时候，它会瞄准仇恨最高的玩家所在的方向。因此，如果它看向的是团队所在的方向，就存在在远程距离内应用上述两种机制的风险……坦克必须快速思考并行动，重新控制首领并将其转向。





### 金拉斯·铁眼

> KINRAS IRONEYE


** 金拉斯·铁眼 **

这个Boss非常庞大和凶猛，但如果你独立分解机制并且专注于机制而不是输出输出输出，它其实并不那么难。我的意思是，不要试图比赛。在这场战斗中没有DPS检测，放松心态并且按照流程进行！

“困难模式”为坦克增加了一些具有挑战性的机制，但是放松心情并吸收差异后并不太困难，特别是当您拥有“秘密boss”（冰形态）的增益时。

* **三重射击** :  老板会用看起来像是轻攻击的技能攻击坦克。这将会在坦克脚下放置一个小AOE。简单地格挡攻击并稍微移出AOE即可。这将会发生三次。这是一种很基本的机制，所以学会了就不会有问题。然而，如果你惊慌失措地四处乱跑，你会死亡。所以放松，并将AOE放在靠近一起并尽量避免停留在其中太久。

* **重击（挥动）** :  在三连发之后，boss将试图向拥有aggro的人（应该是坦克）展开一个巨大的重击，你可以作为坦克来阻挡这个攻击，或者如果你愿意，你可以躲避它。为了控制战局，并且不让房间乱成一团，我鼓励你使用阻挡技能。然而，如果你是一个dps/治疗职业，并且这个攻击瞄准了你，你需要躲避它，否则就会死亡。

* **旗帜** :  首领会将一团火球扔到空中，落在首领随机选择的某个位置。从爆炸处会生成一个小火焰旗帜，不断向小组投掷火球。它可以被嘲讽以使大部分伤害转移到它身上，但是还是要优先击杀它。如果将其列为击杀优先顺序，可以快速结束战斗。这种情况会在整个战斗中每分钟发生一次左右。

* **武器投掷** :  BOSS在75%和30%的血量时会将武器投向房间的另一侧。这时他的攻击会稍作改变。房间两侧会有额外的火焰伤害，还会有火焰AOE在地面滑动，需要避开。

* **重击（哈都剣）** :  这是他独特的空手重击。 他会在远程投掷一个火球！作为坦克一定要阻挡或闪避这个攻击。如果它瞄准了一个 dps/治疗角色，那么需要处理两件事情。

1）你必须闪避才能避免它

2) 坦克使用了嘲讽！

这个技能只攻击仇恨目标，请不要失去嘲讽仇恨！

* **地板是熔岩** :  这位boss会随机选定玩家，在他们脚下施加尖刺和熔岩效果（就像场景外的小怪一样），远离这些地方并避免站在里面。

* **攻略翻译如下
火蜥蜴** :  在战斗中，火蜥蜴（你可以在外面看见这些）将会刷新。它们周围有巨大的火焰光环，并且用它们的重攻击打击力极强。你必须把它们作为主要目标，它们必须死掉。

如果小怪们到达了BOSS身边，他将会变得越来越强，尤其是当他开始释放咆哮技能的时候，即使你认为你已经控制住了这些小怪，它们也会朝着BOSS冲去！（一定要打断BOSS的技能释放）。

然而，火蜥蜴和BOSS可以用不同的方式处理。如果您已经消灭了第一个秘密BOSS，您就可以在房间里获得冰冻形态的加持。

将瓢虫拖到Boss身边，获得增益效果，并在瓢虫与Boss同在光环范围内时进行重型攻击。

火蜥蜴将会变成冰蜥蜴，使得光环的效果反转！它将会变得更弱！！是的，这意味着你现在在一段时间内拥有优势。

注意，你可以通过冰冻术的协同作用将其连接在一起，既可以削弱他，还可以让他晕眩！

与你的团队一起进行战术战斗，计时你的小组中的冰形态！

* **天渊喷泉 仅限困难模式** :  这个机制非常简单，如果你曾经在血根熔炉或鳞调峰之中，那么你一定见过这个机制。首领会对坦克施加看上去像是重击的攻击。当锤子击中地面时，一个大型AOE将会喷出火山岩攻击。坦克需要站在上面并持续格挡以堵住裂缝，否则全团将会承受巨大的伤害并死亡。

* **锁链（仅硬模式）** :  这是一个简单而致命的机制！与上述类似，这也发生在血根熔炉中。首领会用成长中的AOE将小组中的两个成员锁定在地面上。必须尽快打断首领来释放小组成员。一旦他们被释放，他们必须走出AOE范围，否则会受到巨大的火灾伤害。

扩散的AOE是至关重要的部分，大多数人认为打断已经足够......但是错误的，一旦你自由了，就快逃离AOE范围!

攻略翻译如下：

提示：请与您的团队协调好时间，利用您的时间冰封技能来让首领眩晕，从而弥补错误或让蜥蜴蛋减弱首领。每个玩家都能在战斗中获取该技能，但每位玩家都有一个冷却时间。因此，请结合您的团队能力和机制，找出何时何地使用该技能。这个秘密奖励确实能改变游戏的走向。

另外，请注意，使用协同技能不仅会震慑房间，还会复活你的朋友！





### 活力化身

> AVATAR OF VIGOR


** 活力维格化身（秘密BOSS）**

这里的BOSS非常简单，如视频所示，你当然可以抓取冰BUFF并快速沿着山坡跑下来，在战斗开始时晕它，但说实话，这是一场相当简单的战斗。

坦克应时刻将Boss面向团队背后！而团队应该站在Boss身后，不要靠在一起。

* **重击** :  这个机制很好理解，就是阻挡它！

* **间歇泉** :  Boss会在每个玩家脚下召唤一个间歇泉类型的AOE，赶紧走出去，就不会受到伤害了。非常简单！





### 坚韧化身

> AVATAR OF FORTITUDE


**坚毅化身（秘密BOSS）**

这个BOSS非常简单，但攻击力相当高。和上一个BOSS一样（视频中也演示了），如果你让队伍中的某个人及时拿起冰buff，就可以在一开始的时候使BOSS受到眩晕。然而，像往常一样，BOSS应该被控制在房间中心，面向团队的反方向。

* **重击轻击** :  坦克要处理的基本攻击，一定要格挡。

* **上古卷轴在线攻略

冰霜通道** :  这是一个特别危险的机制。Boss会看起来一直在进行一次沉重的攻击。这个攻击无法被打断，你只需要任其发生。治疗师需要真正注意这个机制，因为基本上你只需要用治疗和伤害护盾来抵消它。千万要存活下来！

* **上古卷轴在线游戏攻略

地面冰霜** :  这个情况比较少见，但如果你和Boss战斗时间很长，Boss就会在玩家身下随机放出冰霜，简单地躲开即可。





### 杰米诺斯队长

> CAPTAIN GEMINUS


**杰米诺斯队长** 

（注：该段文本中的html标签已经被省略）

这个Boss非常混乱！然而，稍微集中注意力和保持清晰思维，这场战斗就可以比表面看起来容易得多。有一些非常明显的机制，其中很多都取决于坦克的表现，确保Boss不会在团队中乱转。

总之，对于那些承受攻击的坦克们来说！不要放下BOSS，也不要让BOSS在原地转圈。她会在场上跳来跳去，但是她即是远程又是近战，所以只要你用嘲讽技能攻击她，她最终会来到你的身边。你应该控制好BOSS，而不是让她控制你！放松心态并集中注意力。

同时，小组中的成员不应该聚集在一起，要找到自己的空间。

* **重击** :  首领将对坦克进行重击，类似于跳跃并刺击，有时还会开枪。一定要挡住这个攻击，不然你基本上就会死掉。如果此攻击在除了坦克以外的任何人身上，你必须躲开或你就会死亡。

* **兽陷阱** :  首领会在房间地面上放置兽陷阱。要避开它们。如果被困在其中，你将被禁锢并带有持续性伤害。

* **雷电风** :  BOSS会施放三次风系机制。不要站在它们的路径上。它们可以向前或向后射击，所以不要作为一组堆叠，否则你们可能会同时被击中，这可能会很难处理。这不是一个过于激进的机制，但它肯定没有帮助其他所有事情。如果你真的没有其他地方可去，那么就简单地格挡。但一般来说，只要看好自己的脚步，绕着它们移动就行了。

* **弓箭手** :  房间里会有弓箭手，蓝色的阴影/幽灵类型的生物。他们的血量非常低，但可以很快地杀死其他玩家。他们会对随机玩家释放扩散AOE技能。当技能充能完成时，他们会被击中并受到高额伤害。

* **打断它们来阻止机制的发动并尽快击杀它们在普通的神话模式下你每次只会遇到1** : 2个，而在困难模式下你会遇到3-4个。

这是你在任何时候的主要目标。此战中没有BOSS的DPS检查，所以你可以花费任意的时间。

一定要先消灭弓箭手。

* **标记** :  老板会轮流标记一个玩家。如果你被标记了，你的屏幕会变灰，并且你会有一个长时间的debuff效果。如果你是唯一活着的玩家，此效果将持续大部分时间，否则它会在玩家之间跳转。在这个阶段中，你会受到来自所有来源的更多伤害。确保你带来足够的治疗！

* **火焰通道（无敌阶段）** :  BOSS会进入房间中央并对所有伤害免疫。她会释放多个火元素AOE技能，这些技能会在地板上向不同方向散发。请避免被它们击中。这个机制会一直持续到房间里的侍灵被击杀为止（见下文） 。

她会在大约70%左右进入这个阶段，然后在30%时再次进入。第一阶段会有4个火焰，第二阶段会有6个火焰！

* **空气侍灵** :  当首领无敌并在房间中央释放火焰时，将会在房间中出现一个空气侍灵。坦克需要把它嘲讽并时刻将其背对房间。

这个目标的重击极为强大，需要坦克进行格挡。同时，它还有一个引导的闪电攻击，也应该被格挡或者通过治疗来抵消。

在这个阶段，弓箭手仍然具有优先权，所以要留意周围发生的事情。

一旦侍灵被击败，Boss将脱离免疫状态。

* **火狼** :  在首次无敌阶段后，Boss会在接下来的战斗中循环生成2只狼。对于DPS/治疗角色，它们的攻击力相当强，但坦克应该不会有问题。它们可以被嘲讽、眩晕、锁链等方法控制。时间静止或否决泡泡非常适合处理它们。然而，在它们在房间里时，它们是个问题，所以必须杀掉它们。它们是次于弓箭手的优先攻击目标。

* **横劈  流血** :  当坦克害怕自己的影子时，这是会杀死团队的技能。在无敌阶段后，她不仅会召唤狼群，还会使用新技能。

她会朝着坦克的方向挥动她的武器，产生一个大范围的三角形AOE横劈效果。这是一个直接攻击，然后几乎立即之后她会施展一个更宽的范围攻击。这个攻击会直接打击，并带有一个长时间的大流血效果。一定要把它远离小组成员，除了坦克，没有小组成员应该在附近。

如果DPS/治疗职业被此技能击中，他们要么会死于初始伤害，要么在2个流血效果后死亡。小心，不要让BOSS在原地打转！

* **传送** :  这个BOSS基本上像夜刃一样。她会不停地进行传送。作为坦克，务必盯紧她，无论她在哪里都不要放下嘲讽。

提示：你可以随时利用寒冰增益，但我强烈建议你在狼出现时使用它。

然而，如果你是一支经验丰富的队伍，并且能够注意到她要进入无敌阶段时，你可以阻止她进入那个阶段，并在几秒钟内获得一个免费的攻击时机。但这需要练习。

通常情况下，当你需要缓解压力时，可以使用冰来减轻一些压力。

最终提示：这场战斗没有“dps检测”。如果你能够打断弓箭手，那就用你需要的时间。这完全取决于机制。





### 派罗图格·恩克拉迪斯

> PYROTURGE ENCRATIS


** 派罗图格·恩克拉迪斯 **

最终的Boss，作为最后一关的Boss，其实相当简单。它肯定很引人注目，但非常直截了当，尤其是如果你解锁了秘密技能。但如果你不遵循技能机制，它会变得非常惩罚性。其中大部分都是由坦克来承受，一般一个失误就会导致人员死亡。因此，一定要密切留意那些重击和AOE攻击。

首领应该尽可能静止不动，并且始终背对着团队。团队成员无需贴着首领的面部作战！

攻略翻译如下：

首先，BOSS会在室外与你进行战斗。一旦他的血量降至约60％，他会恢复生命并逃进第二个房间。从技术上讲，基本要领是相同的，但当然后面的房间会有一些额外的机制。

* **火焰喷射器** :  首领将会对坦克使用火焰喷射器，坦克需要格挡。其他DPS或治疗成员需要远离首领的正面。非常简单，不要被烧到！

* **重拳攻击** :  这很简单，首领会对坦克进行重拳攻击。格挡住它。如果你让首领脱离坦克，它会杀死其他人，所以不要让它脱离你的嘲讽。

* **火焰漩涡（脚着火啦哇哦）** :  这看起来非常壮观，而且确实是。首领将在房间中间放出一圈大火圈，然后引导技能。无论你体型有多大，这都会杀死你。快离开。找一块空地，让他完成他的技能。

* **火焰幽灵** :  在火焰漩涡状态下，会出现两个火焰幽灵需要击杀。在困难模式下，会出现四个火焰幽灵！

* **上古卷轴Online游戏攻略

火箭风暴** :  这是与烈焰漩涡正好相反的技能。你需要进入技能范围中心，而不是离开。这次，房间内的整个区域都会着火，只有中心是安全的。当Boss在引导技能时，你可以继续攻击他，同时又不用担心被火焰烧伤。

在困难模式下的第一个或第二个火焰阶段中，要注意房间周围的龙头，因为它们会喷火，你不想靠近它们。

* **攻略如下 

喷泉** :  有趣的部分。后面的火风暴有点不同。首领会跳到房间的另一侧，你需要到达“安全区”才能攻击他。只需从房间的中间跑过去，跳进喷泉。但是你必须确保你面对着安全区，否则你会被弹到火中。 

其中，Geysers为游戏中的地图物品，Firestorm为BOSS技能名称。

* **巨兽** :  这个双手武器你之前就见过了。每当BOSS使用“火之风暴”机制时，会刷新一个巨兽。你必须集中攻击击杀它们。

坦克必须始终将Boss转移到团队之外，并且团队需要将其视为首要目标而非Boss。Boss有严重的重击攻击，并且会在房间里生成陨石，需要阻挡或回避。

* **蜥蜴陷阱** :  在整个战斗中，BOSS会随机朝玩家施放快速移动的蜥蜴，其中一个玩家脚下会有一个圆圈，蜥蜴会追着他们跑。地面上也会有一个小圆圈。把你的圆圈放到那个圆圈里面就可以了，否则在机制结束时你会受到大量的火焰伤害。无论如何，机制都会触发，但这就是你不死的方法！

* **火蜥蜴坑** :  后面的地下室里有火蜥蜴，会让人感到烦恼。你可以杀死它们，也可以避开它们，由你决定。它们不会出来的。

* **乱舞横劈** :  BOSS将会释放乱舞型的横劈技能，这会显示为一个小三角形在BOSS前方。TANK必须格挡这个技能，并且将BOSS面朝远离队伍的方向。DPS或治疗如果被击中就会死亡。

提示：你可以在熔火风暴和烈焰漩涡的机制期间使用冰霜协同，当然还可以杀死燃烧鬼魂，或者在你所处的阶段眩晕boss和巨兽。这也可以定时停止它！因此，与团队一起规划使用该增益的时间，以实现最大效果！

如果你能充分吸收游戏机制，实际上你可以花更多的时间攻击一个不动的目标而不是在房间里跳来跳去。但这需要一些练习。

> ** SENTINEL AKSALAZ (SUPER SECRET BOSS) |cffff00**
> 
> This boss is the SUPER secret boss and can ONLY be activated if you have completed ALL secret bosses!
> 
> The regular version of the boss requires the 3 secret bosses prior to this. The hard mode version of this boss requires ALL secrets and ALL hard modes before this!
> 
> You each must have 25 wisps at the end of the dungeon to deposit into the statue at the back of the last boss room, OR have 100 combined for the entire group. Once you activate the statue he will appear.
> 
> One final twist. If you fail this boss 5 times...he will disappear. Pay attention and don't let him get away !
> 
> This boss needs to be kept as STILL as possible to lay off some of the crazy in here, and the tank needs to turn it away from the group at ALL times! He hits HARD, bring heals!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Imagine every heavy attack you have ever seen, and put them all together. BLOCK this or be teleported to the dead pile!
> 
> On Hard Mode this puts a HUGE damage over time effect on the targets hit by it, you MUST bring big heals for this.
> 
> **Ice Channel/Spikes** - The boss will put his sword into the ground and channel ice AOEs that will spawn under each player. Move your feet so they don't burst under you. Each player will have 3 of these pop from under them then he will stop. If you get hit you are basically dead so be careful.
> 
> On Hard Mode this puts a HUGE damage over time effect on the targets hit by it, you MUST bring big heals for this.
> 
> **Ice Swing** - This is a frontal, multiple hit, moving aoe ability so NO ONE but the tank should be anywhere near this!
> 
> On Hard Mode this puts a HUGE damage over time effect on the targets hit by it, you MUST bring big heals for this.
> 
> **Frostkins/Banekins** - These come in the room one at a time (two at a time on hard mode) and MUST be considered your PRIMARY targets. Leaving these in the room to kill people is silly. Kill them. The boss has NO 'DPS CHECK' so take as long as you like on the boss, but you must kill the minions.
> 
> **Ice Comets** - Random players will have a HUGE spreading AOE on them. When it reaches maximum an Ice Comet will land on their head. This must be BLOCKED in a SAFE place and NOT stacked on any other players. Throughout the fight more and more players will get these at once and they must NEVER overlap.
> 
> On Hard Mode at 25% health and under all 4x players will have an Ice Comet each per phase, watch your feet, everyone must block their own comet and NO ONE should overlap.
> 
> **Secret Bosses!** - The bosses you fought in the dungeon before come out to play! They have their FULL mechanics like they did before but they are in the room with everything else you have to deal with. This is simple. The tank needs to grab the mini boss and the main boss and keep them turned away at ALL times.
> 
> Each boss will come in at health percentages depending on how fast you are killing the boss (he could be mid mechanics at the moment and you can over nuke it).
> 
> The first boss will come in at 85%
> 
> The second boss will come in at 60%
> 
> and the last boss will come in at 35%
> 
> Your primary focus is are still the Banekins if they are in the room but if there are NO Banekins you MUST focus the mini boss over the main one. You do NOT want to over nuke the boss and have TWO mini bosses in the room.
> 
> Keep it simple, don't be stupid.
> 
> **Whirlwinds!** - The boss will cast whirl winds around the room that spin in an anit-clockwise rotation and you need to stick to the edges and run around without being caught by them. At the same time the middle of the room is going to explode in ice so you must NOT be in there.
> 
> Find a gap, run around in a circle, and come back in when it is all over!
> 
> NOTE: Make sure as a tank you maintain a taunt. Most groups wipe here because when it is all over the boss is loose. Focus!
> 
> **There is NO ROOM! (Execute Phase)** - 25% and under it is the 'execute' phase. Basically the same rules apply, there is NO race...you do NOT have to make this a FAST phase, take your time and keep your mechanics clean. Even if you are down to 1k dps you can still kill the boss if you are not dead!
> 
> Basically the outside of the room is covered in ice and the whole room is a no go area apart from the very middle. Here he will continue his basic mechanics. Ice Comets, Banekins, Ice Channel/spikes, everything is the same, but the space is limited.
> 
> At the same time, you will not only have the frontal aoe ice attack from the boss but it will be constantly flying in from the sides too and you MUST watch your feet and get in the gaps.
> 
> Here you literally rinse repeat mechanics until he is dead. However long it takes!
> 
> TIP: On hardmode at the END you will have 4x Ice Comets. You must NOT stack, find a corner each quickly (demonstrated in the video), block, and then carry on as normal. Note the Banekins STILL take priority over the boss.
> 
> GOOD LUCK!!!

> 
> ** AVATAR OF ZAL - (SECRET BOSS) **
> 
> As shown in the video each player must stand on a pressure pad in order to open the trap door. Once activated you can go down stairs, activate the statue and summon the boss.
> 
> This boss is VERY simple, just be sure the tank maintains a taunt at all times and turns it away from the group no matter what happens.
> 
> **Mind Blast!** - The boss will occasionally rise up onto it's back legs and cast a mind blast type ability in front of it. It will hit each and every player in front of it repeatedly and hits very hard if received by a dps/healer player. You need to be sure the boss is turned away from the group or the group deliberately place behind the boss when this happens.
> 
> **Spectral Bambi!?** - The boss will occasionally cast a stun effect which will look like 3 Spectral Indriks charging forwards at once. This should be facing the tank, if for ANY reason this is aimed at a dps/healer, they must block it or be knocked down and take high damage. Stacking the top two mechanics together can get messy really fast so again, be sure the boss is facing the tank and not the group.
> 
> **Teleport** - To keep you on your toes the boss will teleport around the room. When it teleports of course it will aim in the direction of where ever the player with aggro is standing. So if it is looking in the direction of the group has the risk of applying the above two mechanics at range...The tank must think and move quickly to regain control of the boss and turn it around.

> ** KINRAS IRONEYE **
> 
> This boss is BIG and MEAN and actually not as tough as he looks, IF you break up the mechanics individually and focus heavily on the mechanics and not the nuke. What i mean by that is, don't try to make it a race. There is NO 'dps check' in this fight, just relax and go through the motions!
> 
> Hard mode adds some challenging mechanics for the tank, but again, relax and absorb the differences and it is not too much trouble, especially when you have the Secret boss buff (ice form).
> 
> **Triple Shot** - The Boss will hit the tank with what looks like a light attack. This will place a small aoe on the ground under the tank's feet. Simple block the hit and move slightly out of the AOE. This will happen THREE times. It's a vert routine based mechanics so learn it and it won't be a problem ever. However if you panic and run around the room you will die. So relax, and just place the AOEs close together and avoid staying in them too long.
> 
> **Heavy attack (Swing)** - After the Triple shot the boss will attempt to wind up a huge heavy attack at whoever has aggro (should be the tank) you can BLOCK this as a tank, or if you prefer you can dodge roll it. For control sake and for not making a mess of the room i would encourage you to block it. If you have this aimed at you as a dps/healer however, you need to dodge roll it or die.
> 
> **Banner** - The boss will throw a ball of flame up in the air and it will land in a random location of the boss's choosing. From that explosion will spawn a small fire banner. This will constantly throw fireballs at the group. It can be taunted to make MOST of the damage, however, kill it. If you put this at your list of priorities to focus on, you can get it out of the fight nice and quick. These will happen throughout the fight around once a minute.
> 
> **Weapon Throw** - The boss will at 75% and 30% throw his weapon to the other side of the room. When this happens his attacks will change slightly. The sides of the room will become unsafe with extra fire damage and also flame aoes will slide across the floor which you should avoid.
> 
> **Heavy Attack (Hadoken)** - This is his unique unarmed heavy attack. He will cast a fireball at range! Be sure to block or dodge this as the tank. If this is aimed at a dps/healer then two things need to be addressed.
> 
> 1) You must dodge to avoid it
> 
> 2) the tank dropped the taunt!
> 
> This ONLY attacks the person with aggro, don't lose the taunt!
> 
> **The Floor is lava!!** - The boss will target random players with spikes and lava type effects under their feet (much like the add outside) move away from these and avoid standing in them.
> 
> **Salamanders** - During the fight salamanders (you saw these outside) will spawn into the fight. They have a huge flame aura around them and they hit very hard with their heavy attacks. These should be your PRIMARY focus. They MUST die.
> 
> If they reach the boss he will get stronger and stronger when he starts to channel his ROAR ability even if you think you have control of them, they will run to him! (be sure to interrupt this).
> 
> HOWEVER, the Salamanders and the boss can be dealt with in a DIFFERENT way. IF you have taken out the first secret boss, you have access to the Ice Form buff in the room.
> 
> Drag the Salamanders to the boss, take the buff and HEAVY ATTACK salamanders when they are in the aura with the boss.
> 
> The salamanders will turn to ICE instead of FIRE making the Aura do the reverse! He will be weaker!! Yes that means YOU have the advantage now for a time.
> 
> NOTE you can link this together with the synergy from ice form in order to not only debuff him, but stun him too!
> 
> Play tactical with your team and time the ice forms in your group!
> 
> **Geyser (Hard Mode Only)** - This is REALLY simple, if you have been in Bloodroot forge or Scale Caller Peak you have seen this mechanic before. The boss will apply what LOOKS like a heavy attack on the tank. When the hammer hits the ground a large AOE will spew out volcanic rock attacks. The tank needs to stand on this and plug the hole while holding block or the group will take huge damage and die.
> 
> **Chains! (Hard Mode Only)** - This is a simple and deadly mechanic! Much like the above, this is also in Bloodroot forge. The boss will chain two members of the group to the ground with a growing AOE under them. The boss must be interrupted as soon as possible to release the group members.  Once they are free they must get OUT of the AOE or take HUGE fire damage.
> 
> The spreading AOE is the crucial part as most people think the interrupt is enough...wrong, once you are free, get OUT!
> 
> TIPS: Time your Ice Form buffs with your group and utilize them as much as you can to stun the boss to recover from mistakes OR to make the salamanders weaken him. Each player will be able to take the buff during the fight but you all have a  cool down once you have taken it. So figure out when and where you should use them vs your group's capability with the mechanics. That secret bonus is quite literally a game changer.
> 
> Also note, using the synergy not only stuns the room, but also resurrects your friends!
> 
> 
> 
> AVATAR OF VIGOR
> 
> 
> ** AVATAR OF VIGOR (SECRET BOSS) **
> 
> The boss here is very simple, as shown in the video you can of course grab the ice buff and run down the hill quickly to stun it as the fight starts but honestly this is a fairly simple fight.
> 
> The tank should hold the boss facing away from the group at all times! and the group should stay behind and NOT stack together.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This mechanic pretty self explanatory, block it!
> 
> **Geysers** - The boss will summon a geyser type AOE under each player, move out of this before it goes off and you will take no damage. Easy Peasy!
> 
> 
> 
> AVATAR OF FORTITUDE
> 
> 
> ** AVATAR OF FORTITUDE (SECRET BOSS) **
> 
> This boss is very simple but does hit fairly hard. Much like the last one (demonstrated in the video also) this boss can be stunned at the beginning if you make someone pick up the ice buff on time. However as per usual, this boss should be held in the middle of the room facing AWAY from the group
> 
> **Heavy/Light Attacks** - Basic hits for the tank to deal with, be sure to block.
> 
> **Ice Channel** - This is a particularly dangerous mechanic. The boss will look like it is constantly channeling a heavy attack. This is not able to be interrupted and you literally just have to let it happen. The healer needs to really be on point with this mechanic because basically you simply need to out heal it with heals and damage shields. Stay alive!
> 
> **Ground Ice** - It's rare to happen but if you are in the fight a long time the boss will cast ice under players at random, simply move out of these.
> 
> 
> 
> CAPTAIN GEMINUS
> 
> 
> ** CAPTAIN GEMINUS **
> 
> This boss is chaotic as hell! However, a little bit of focus and a clear mind and this fight can be a lot easier than it looks on the surface. there are some VERY clear mechanics and a lot of it is on the tank making sure the boss doesn't spin around at the group.
> 
> So above all, to those tanks out there! Do NOT drop the boss, and do NOT spin the boss around in circles. She will jump around all over the place, but she is melee AND ranged, so long as she is taunted she will eventually come to you. You are in control of the boss, not the other way around! Relax and focus.
> 
> In the mean time the group should never stack, find your own space.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss will Heavy attack the tank, kind of a jump and stab and occasionally shoot, mechanic. Be sure to block this or you are basically dead. If for any reason this is on anyone BUT the tank, you MUST dodge roll it or you will die.
> 
> **Beast Traps** - The boss will cast beast traps in the room on the ground. Avoid them. If you get caught in them you will be immobilized and take damage over time.
> 
> **Lightning/winds** - The boss will cast wind type mechanics in threes. Simply don't stand in the way of them. They can fire in front or behind her so do not stack as a group else you could all get hit at once and it can  be a pain to manage. It's not an over the top aggressive mechanic but it certainly doesn't help with everything else going on. If you really have no where else to go, simply block. But in general just watch your feet and move around them.
> 
> **Archers** - There will be Archers in the room, blue shadow/spectral type beings. They have incredibly LOW health but can kill people pretty quick. They will target random players with a spreading AOE. When it fills up they will be shot and take HIGH damage.
> 
> Interrupt these to stop the mechanic happening and be sure to kill them as soon as you can. On regular veteran mode you will get 1-2 of these at a time, on hard mode you get 3-4 of them.
> 
> These are your PRIMARY target at ALL times. There is NO 'dps check' on this fight for the boss so take as long as you like.
> 
> Always kill the Archers
> 
> **Marked!!!** - The boss will mark one player at a time on random rotation. If you are marked your screen will go grey and you will have a long duration debuff on you. If you are the only one alive it will be with you for MOST of the duration, if not it will jump around. It's pretty simple, during this phase YOU take more damage from all sources. Make sure you bring those heals!
> 
> **Channel Fire (invulnerability phase)** - The boss will go into the middle of the room and be invulnerable to all damage and she will be channeling forcing out multiple fire AOEs across the floor in different directions. AVOID getting hit by these. This mechanic will remain ongoing until the Atronach in the room (see below) is killed.
> 
> She will enter this phase roughly around 70% and then again at 30%. The first phase there will be 4 flames, the second phase will be 6!
> 
> **Air Atronach** - When the boss is invulnerable and channeling fire in the middle of the room an Air Atronach will spawn in the room. This needs to be taunted by the tank and turned away from the room at all times.
> 
> This target has a HUGE heavy attack which the tank must block and a channeled lightning attack which also should be blocked and/or out healed.
> 
> Archers still take priority during this phase so be aware of what is going on around you.
> 
> Once the Air Atronach is dead, the boss will come out of her immunity phase.
> 
> **Fire Wolves** - After the first invulnerability phase the boss will spawn 2 wolves on rotation over and over for the rest of the fight. These hit pretty hard against a dps/healer role but the tank should have no trouble. They can be taunted, Stunned, Chained etc. Time stop or negate bubble works great for managing these. However while they are in the room, they are a problem so they must be killed. They are a priority second to the Archers.
> 
> **Double Cleave & Bleed!** - This is the one that kills the group when tanks get scared of their own shadow. After the invulnerability stage, not only do the wolves come out but she has a new attack.
> 
> She will swing her weapon with a LARGE triangle AOE cleave effect at the direction of the tank. This is a direct attack, then almost instantly after she will cast another wider one to go with it. This has a direct hit and carries a HUGE long duration bleed with it. Be sure to turn this away from the group at all costs, and NO group member should be anywhere near it but the tank.
> 
> If a DPS/Healer gets hit by this their will either die to the initial hit OR die withing just 2 ticks of the bleed. Be careful and do NOT spin the boss around in circles!
> 
> **Teleport** - The boss is pretty much a Nightblade of sorts. She ill teleport all over the place. Keep eyes on her as the tank and do NOT drop taunt no matter where she is.
> 
> TIP: Make use of the Ice buff whenever you like but i would highly recommend you use it when the wolves come in.
> 
> However if you are an experienced group and can notice when she is going to go into her invulnerability stage, you can PREVENT her for a few seconds from going into that phase and get a free nuke moment. But that will take practice.
> 
> Generally use the ice to free up some stress when you need to.
> 
> FINAL NOTE: There is no 'dps check' on this fight. If you can interrupt the archers, take as long as you need. it's ALL mechanics.
> 
> 
> 
> PYROTURGE ENCRATIS
> 
> 
> ** PYROTURGE ENCRATIS **
> 
> The Final boss, for a last boss, is actually pretty simple. It's dramatic for sure but it is straight forward, ESPECIALLY if you have the secret power unlocked. The mechanics are very punishing though if you don't follow them. Most of it is on the tank and one mess up generally will kill people. So pay close attention to those heavy attacks and AOEs.
> 
> The boss should be held as still as possible and turned away from the group at ALL times. The group has NO business being in the boss's face!
> 
> To start with the boss will be fighting you outside, once he hits about 60% health he will heal up and run into the second room. The mechanics are technically the same for the main basics but of course the back room has some extras.
> 
> **Flame Thrower** - The boss will channel a flame thrower type mechanic at the tank. BLOCK THIS! Any dps or healer types stay OUT of the boss's face. Really simple. DON'T get burnt!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Pretty straight forward, the boss will heavy attack the tank. Block it. If you drop the boss it will kill others so don't drop your taunt.
> 
> **Flaming Vortex! (feets on fire zomg!)** - This looks VERY dramatic, and it is. The boss will channel in the middle of the room with a big circle of fire under his feet. I doesn't matter how chunky you are, this will KILL you. Get out. Find a space and let him finish his mechanic.
> 
> **Flame Ghosts** - During the Flaming Vortex x2 Flaming ghosts will come out and you will have to kill them. On hardmode however you will get x4 of them!
> 
> **FireStorm** - This is the direct opposite of the Flaming Vortex. Instead of getting OUT of the circle, you need to be IN the circle. This time the center is the only safe spot because the WHOLE room will be on fire. While the boss is channeling you can continue to hit him while staying safe from the fire.
> 
> During either of the fire phases on Hard mode, watch for the Dragon heads around the room as they will breath fire and you do not want to be near them.
> 
> **Geysers!!!** - The fun part. The Firestorm in the BACK room is a little different. The boss will jump across the room and you need to get to him in the 'safe spot'. Simply run through the MIDDLE of the room and jump into the Geyser. BUT you must be sure you are facing the safe zone, else you will be pinged into the fire.
> 
> **Behemoth** - This two hander add you have dealt with before. Whenever the boss is doing the Firestorm mechanic, one of these will spawn. It is crucial that you focus these.
> 
> The tank must turn it away from the group at all times and the group need to consider this a primary target OVER the boss. He has nasty heavy attacks and will spawn meteors in the room which need to be blocked and/or avoided.
> 
> **Salamander Trap** - Throughout the fight the boss will cast what looks like fast moving Salamanders at random players, and ONE will have a circle under their feet while a salamander chases them. Also on the floor will be a small circle. Put YOUR circle inside THAT circle and you will be fine. If not, by the time the mechanic is over you will take HIGH fire damage. Either way the mechanic will go off but that is how you don't DIE!
> 
> **Salamander Pit** - Salamanders down below in the back room, are there to be annoying.  You can kill them or you can avoid them, it's up to you. They don't come out of there anyway.
> 
> **Flurry/Cleave** - The boss will channel a flurry type Cleave mechanic shown as a SMALL triangle affect in front of him. This must be blocked by the tank and MUST be faced AWAY from the group. DPS or Healers will die to this.
> 
> TIPS: You can turn OFF the Firestorm and Flaming Vortex mechanics by activating your Ice synergy during it and of course kill flaming ghosts, or stun the boss and Behemoth depending on which stage you are at. This can also be timed to STOP him from activating it! So plan your use of that buff with your group for maximum effectiveness!
> 
> If you can full absorb the mechanics, you can actually spend more time hitting a sitting duck than jumping around the room. it will take a little practice though.
