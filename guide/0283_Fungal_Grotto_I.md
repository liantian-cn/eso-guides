## 真菌岩洞 I

> Fungal Grotto I




### Fungal Grotto I的汉语翻译为真菌岩洞 I。

> TAZKAD THE PACKMASTER


** 扎克德，兽群大师 **

这个Boss带着一个小队，他们不是太强，但你需要让你的坦克首先吸引Boss的注意力，然后把其他敌人拉得离他尽可能近。2个弓箭手如果试图释放他们的酸雾型能力，可以打断他们，而三个达佐格通常可以通过AOE攻击快速击败。如果你被敌人攻击了，不要逃跑，只需格挡并让坦克把狗牵走，然后集中攻击Boss。他身边的垃圾怪物相对血量很低，所以虽然它们可能一开始会造成问题，但它们不会存在太久。

* **鲜血狂暴** :  一种相当基本的物理伤害攻击，对于一个健康的坦克来说，造成的伤害很小，这个攻击不应该成为什么问题，但如果你是一个输出职业，只要你有一个盾牌或者从治疗师那里得到一个小小的治疗，这不会成为问题。虽然伤害很小，但一定要注意自己是否中招了，如果需要，及时寻求治疗。

* **痛苦** :  很像夜刃技能，这将被施放在控制仇恨的人身上（通常是坦克）。它会造成小量持续伤害并造成最初的晕眩。所以如果你被抓住了，你必须挣脱出来，但是这个技能有施放时间并且可以被打断。请注意这个效果。





### 战争酋长奥佐扎伊

> WAR CHIEF OZOZAI


**战争酋长奥佐扎伊**

这场战斗很简单，但如果你的团队不注意范围伤害和某些机制时该如何摆放自己的位置，很容易变得混乱。

首领会一开始有两个卫兵协助作战，你需要快速将它们杀死以避免麻烦。它们具备盾牌冲撞技能和能够造成大范围伤害的龙骑士战旗。必须先杀死它们！坦克需要将首领聚集在一起，并注意其猛烈攻击，攻击有些延迟，所以要尽早格挡以免被弹来弹去。攻击输出可以格挡并存活下来，如果它们获得首领的仇恨，请不要逃走。

* **电击冲击** :  战斗一开始，当Boss准备攻击时，他会向他选择的目标（除非被嘲讽）发射并跳下平台。着陆时，他会进行一次大范围的电击冲击攻击，打击初始点及周围的小范围AOE。因此，当Boss跳下来时，你的DPS和治疗师应该分散开来以避免受到影响。

“Daedric Blast”——偶尔，奥佐扎伊会在你的团队成员身上释放一束红色光束，并在玩家脚下开始形成扩散的范围伤害。一旦达到极限，它就会爆炸。你有两种选择，一是离开你的团队，让它爆炸（同时按住格挡键），二是让团队远离你。以最方便的方式进行。但一定要记得格挡或护盾。被爆炸波及到的其他人当然会受到伤害。

“Staggering Roar”——当它生命值偏低时（激怒机制），它会偶尔咆哮，对周围造成适中的物理伤害。如果你是远程输出或治疗角色的话，可以避免受到影响，但如果你是近战角色，请确保在此发生时阻挡或远离。这种情况会一直持续，直到它或你死亡为止。





### 育母蟹灵

> BROODBIRTHER


**育母蟹灵**

这个首领有两个手下，坦克应该嘲讽并把它们堆在首领上方。重要的是，坦克要把首领背对着团队，以避免任何正面区域效果对他们造成影响。所有的 dps 和治疗应该在首领的后面。这两个手下应该很快被区域攻击消灭，但一定要快速杀死它们，坦克在这场战斗中需要进行大量的格挡，因此最好不要耗尽他/她的资源。

* **攻略翻译如下
拉链** :  在战斗过程中，BOSS会随机抓住一个队友并将其拉向他的脚下。不要惊慌，一旦你被拉近，立即回到你原来待的位置，让坦克继续吸引BOSS的仇恨。需要注意的是，如果你离BOSS太远，他会不断把你拉过来，所以要保持相对靠近的距离。

* **电击耙** :  这是一个锥形AOE效果，瞄准谁拥有敌对仇恨（希望是坦克）。它是一系列迅速的连击，会造成闪电伤害，如果没有格挡，伤害会相当高。确保你的坦克格挡这个机制并保持静止，不要四处奔跑，因为锥形区域会跟随你的位置并撞击团队。提示：不要让BOSS旋转！

攻击中大部分都是轻攻击，伤害不是很高，即使DPS也能承受得住，但是偶尔会有针对你的重攻击，记住一定要格挡。它并不会一击必杀，但如果你不断地被击飞，那就会有问题。





### 响螯

> CLATTERCLAW


**响螯**

这个boss非常直截了当，让你的坦克尽可能保持他静止，而你的输出职业施加伤害。一般来说，像大多数boss一样，在可能的情况下，让你的输出职业和治疗职业站在boss的后面（或侧面），这样他们就不会被boss面对。

* **泥蟹虫群** :  这个BOSS的机制很简单，几乎总是使用重攻击，但是如果你的小队缺乏伤害或者特别缺乏范围伤害，他的虫群机制将会非常棘手。

* **每隔大约10秒钟（有时更短）他会生成约8** : 10只泥蟹。它们非常小，类似于你在与Boss战斗前遇到的虫群，但当然你要同时应付这些泥蟹和Boss。解决这个问题的简单方法是让你的坦克使用某种群控技能（例如，如果你是龙骑士，可以使用龙爪；如果你是典狱长，则可以使用抓握），然后用AOE伤害将它们消灭，同时专注于攻击Boss。

注意：如果泥蟹攻击你，请不要逃跑，只需待在治疗范围内继续做你正在做的事情，逃跑会导致整场战斗混乱，使得控制失去控制！





### 蟹灵王克拉格

> KRA'GH THE DREUGH KING


**蟹灵王克拉格** 攻略

真菌岩洞 I 的最终BOSS有一些简单但毁灭性的玩法，其中一个对于输出或治疗者在困难模式下是一定会一击必杀的机制。你的团队需要协同作战，你的坦克需要尽可能静止不动。

* **突刺** :  这基本上是一个重型攻击，但如果不格挡的话，它会将坦克猛击出去很远，如果它击中不格挡的DPS，它将会导致其死亡。请注意格挡。

* **暴风雪舞** :  这是一种针对坦克（或拥有仇恨的目标）的快速打击闪电攻击。一个非常强大的坦克可以承受全部的攻击，但我强烈建议阻挡它，如果你是dps，一定要确保你阻挡。

* **泥蟹大军** :  这个名字已经很说明问题了。就像响螯一样，他会钻进地下，并召唤泥蟹来攻击你。这个并不是很紧张，因为只有大概3-4只泥蟹，但它们必须要很快地死掉。在BOSS的下面放置AOE伤害，然后坦克将它们固定在原地应该就足够了。

* **闪电领域** :  这是战斗中最明显和致命的机制，即使是最有经验的玩家也会变得过于自信而死亡。克拉格会在地面上释放一个扩散的大范围AOE效果，一旦它达到顶点就会爆炸！除非你是坦克，任何被这个机制影响到的人都会死亡。不要傻站在里面！一定要快速地离开，让它爆炸，然后再回到战斗中。坦克有两个选择......格挡它并被击倒，或者和其他小组成员一样，离开并重新进入战斗。

首先，这是一个非常流动的战斗，由于一些机制，所以一定要回到位置上，尽可能地让首领保持静止，不要让它肆意奔跑。

> This boss has a little army with him, they are not too tough but you are going to need to get your tank to first of all grab the boss and then pull the additional enemies as close to him as possible. The 2 archers can be interrupted if they attempt to fire off their acid spray type ability and the 3 Durzogs can usually be dispatched quickly with aoe damage. Don't run away if you get agro, simply block and let the tank get the dogs off you and then focus the boss afterwards. The trash he has with him are relatively low health so although they can cause a problem to start with, they wont be there for long.
> 
> **Blood Craze** - A pretty basic physical damage attack which to a healthy tank will do minimal damage, this attack shouldn't cause much of a problem at all but if you are a dps, so long as you have a shield available or a small heal from the healer this won't be much of an issue. A very small amount of damage but be sure to note when you have it so you can get a heal if need be.
> 
> **Agony** - Very much like the Nightblade ability, this will be cast on the person with agro(usually the tank). This does a small amount of damage over time and initially stuns. So if you are caught you will have to break free, HOWEVER this ability has a cast time and CAN be interrupted. Keep your eyes peeled for this effect.

> This fight is a simple one but can get messy fast if your team don't pay attention to aoe damage and how to place themselves when certain mechanics occur.
> 
> The boss starts with 2 guards who will assist him in the fight to start with both of which you will need to kill fast to avoid any complications. They have shield charge abilities and also a Dragonknight standard which does large aoe damage. Kill these FIRST! For the tank, try to center the boss and watch out for his heavy attacks, they are slightly delayed so block EARLY to avoid getting ping ponged around the room. DPS can block this and survive also if they gain agro. do NOT run away.
> 
> **Shock Assault** - As soon as the fight is started and the boss is ready to attack he will launch off the platform at the target of his choosing (unless taunted). Upon landing he will hit with a large shock assault attack which hits the initial point and a small aoe radius around it. So when the boss jumps in, have your dps and healers spread out to avoid this impact.
> 
> **Daedric Blast** - Occasionally Ozozai will cast a red beam on a member of your group and this will start a spreading aoe effect under the player's feet. Once this reaches its peak it will explode. You have two choices, move away from your group and let it explode(while holding block) OR have the group move away from you. Which ever is easiest. Be sure to be blocking or shielding however. Anyone else caught in the explosion will of course take damage.
> 
> **Staggering Roar** - When he is low health (enraged mechanic) he will occasionally shout! Doing moderate physical damage in aoe. This can be avoided if you are a ranged dps or healer but if you are melee be sure to block or move away when this happens. This continues until he or you are dead.

> 
> This boss has two minions who should be taunted and stacked on top of the boss by the tank. It is important that the tank turns the boss away from the group to avoid any frontal aoe effects hitting them. All dps and healers should be BEHIND the boss. The 2 minions should die quite fast to aoe but be sure to kill them fast, the tank has a lot of blocking to do in this fight and it is safe to not over burn his/her resources.
> 
> **Pull/Chain** - Randomly through out the fight the boss will turn on one of the group members and PULL them in to his feet, do not panic, once you are pulled simply move away back to where you were and have your tank keep agro on him. Note if you go TOO far away from the boss he will just keep pulling you in so stay fairly close.
> 
> **Shocking Rake** - This is a frontal cone shaped aoe effect aimed at whoever has the agro (hopefully the tank). It is a rapid series of hits which cause lightning damage and hit pretty hard if not blocking. Be sure that your tank is blocking this mechanic and standing STILL, do not run around because the cone will follow your position and hit the group. TIP: Don't spin the boss!
> 
> The remainder of the attacks are mostly light attacks which don't hit so hard, even a dps can take it, but you will occasionally get a heavy attack aimed at you. Be sure to block this. It isn't a one shot as such  but can  be problematic if you keep getting thrown about.

> 
> This boss is VERY straight forward, have your tank keep him as still as possible while your dps applies damage. Generally as with most bosses it makes sense to get your dps and healers to stand behind the boss if possible (or to the side) so that they are not in his face.
> 
> **Mudcrab Swarm** - This boss has some very basic mechanics in that he pretty much only ever really heavy attacks BUT if your group is lacking damage or specifically aoe damage his swarm mechanic can be pretty tough.
> 
> Every 10seconds or so (sometimes less) he will spawn around 8-10 mudcrabs. These are very small, similar to the swarms you encountered before the boss fight but of course you have those AND the boss to deal with. The simple solution to this is to have your tank put down some form of crowd control (ie talons if on a Dragonknight, grip if you are a warden etc) and then burn them down with aoe damage while focusing the boss.
> 
> NOTE: DO NOT run away if mudcrabs are hitting you, just stay in the heals and keep doing what you are doing, running means you will make a mess of the fight and all control goes out of the window!

> 
> The final boss in Fungal Grotto I has some simple yet devastating mechanics, one above all which to a dps or healer is a guaranteed ONE SHOT on hard mode. Your group need to coordinate and your tank needs to be as still as possible.
> 
> **Lunging strike** - This is pretty much a heavy attack but it will knock the tank for miles if not blocked and if it hits a dps who does not block it WILL kill them.
> 
> **Storm Flurry** - This is a rapid striking lightning attack aimed at the tank (or whoever has agro) A very strong tank could take the full flurry but i would highly recommend blocking it, and if you are a dps definitely make sure you block it.
> 
> **Horde of Mudcrabs** - Pretty much what it says on the tin. Just like Clatterclaw he will dig into the ground and spawn mudcrabs to attack you. This is not so stressful as it is only about 3-4 crabs but they must die fast. Aoe damage on the floor under the boss while the tank pins them in place should be more than enough.
> 
> **Lightning Field** - This is the most obvious and deadly mechanic in the fight and even the most experienced players get cocky with it and die. Kra'gh will channel a spreading LARGE aoe effect on the ground and then once it reaches its peak it will explode! unless you are a tank, ANYONE caught in this, is dead. Do NOT stand in stupid! Be sure to get out as fast as possible, let it explode, then get back in again. The tank has two choices...Block it and get knocked down, or do the same as the rest of the group. Get out and get back in again.
> 
> Above all this is quite a mobile fight due to some of the mechanics so be sure to get back into position and hold that boss still as much as you can, don't let him run wild.
