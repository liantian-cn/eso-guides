### 崛起废墟

> RISEN RUINS


翻译：在**升起的遗迹**中。

这是地下城的第一个拉怪点杀。虽然它只是第一个首领，但它确实在早期教会了你一些重要的课程，引入了整个地下城中最重要的机制之一，同时提醒你如果你以前玩过艾瑟利安档案或谜城遗迹，那么你会发现一些熟悉的机制。这个首领有时相当机动，坦克必须尽可能地让它背对老大，以便可以控制其默认的移动机制。或者人们只需要注意脚下的位置！

* **地面跺脚** :  首领会连续跺地，造成范围伤害。伤害并不是很高，只有坦克真正需要注意威胁，但DPS应该在合适的时机保持输出，并确保治疗在这种情况下保持一致。

* **扔石头坐下** :  怪物会变得免疫，并每秒朝小队扔石头。这些石头与Aetherian Archive和Ruins of Mazzatun中的机制相同，基本上必须使用格挡来避免被击倒和造成巨大的伤害。

有两种方法可以打破这个防御盾。一种方法是全力治疗团队成员，让其保持持续输出。另一种方法是前往黄色区域，协同作战然后用重击打掉红色的球形护盾，以摧毁该BOSS的防御盾。

如果做得正确，他会再次站起来，战斗将继续。

**警告：**使用该配合技能会损失50%的生命值，因此请务必确保在使用前不要生命值过低！同时，使用该配合技能并被石头击中会致死。

* **岩石滑坡（嗖嗖）** :  鲨鱼站起来之后，它将面向其aggro的方向，然后直线行驶穿过房间。如果你被卷入其中，你将被碾压而死。要远离鲨鱼的路径。注意躲避鲨鱼移动的方向。

* **增援敌人** :  在无敌阶段之后和周围，房间里会涌入大量增援敌人。你应该优先处理它们，以免被它们压倒。有些需要打断，有些需要避开范围攻击，但你应该作为坦克将它们堆在一起，而作为 dps 和治疗者，不要在房间里转圈奔跑。掌控节奏，管理它们。





### 多罗扎卡

> DRO'ZAKAR


攻略翻译如下：打败DRO'ZAKAR（VMOL闪回！）

这个BOSS可以非常顺利地过关，也可以变成一团糟。对大多数玩家来说，这相对来说比较容易，但是在某些阶段需要进行协调，以避免玩家相互伤害。BOSS应该始终背对着团队并由坦克控制！

* **攻略翻译如下
吸取血红蛋白** :  boss战斗过程中，小怪将会进入房间并暴露出血红蛋白球（你也可以使用配合技能自己暴露它们）。这些小怪会在球暴露时自我牺牲并爆炸（在视频中，它们被卡在门里）。当球暴露出来后，boss将试图从中吸取能量。你必须对球进行重击并摧毁它。如果你没有及时处理，房间将会爆炸并且造成大量伤害，你将全灭。

* **横劈** :  这个首领有一个重型攻击和横劈机制，作为坦克，你必须格挡它，否则一个DPS很可能被一击致命。千万不要让首领面向团队，否则在尝试复活被它击杀的队员时会造成严重问题。

* **攻略翻译
小怪** :  在战斗期间会有很多基础垃圾小怪进入房间。坦克应该尽可能地将它们堆叠在首领身上，如果你的小队DPS相对较低，你应该优先击杀小怪而非首领。远程目标在施放技能时需要打断，所以要小心不要被发射的地面AOE伤害困住，如果你错过了打断它们的机会。

* **攻略翻译
小怪** :  血之污泥和Spinldeclutch II中的相似。首领会变成地上的一堆污泥，并追随最后引起敌对的人（通常是坦克）。只需保持不动和格挡，污泥对你造成的伤害会治疗首领。当你格挡时首领造成的伤害会减少，因此治疗效果相应减弱。这种状态只持续几秒钟，但要小心，因为首领通常在结束时会发动一次猛烈的攻击。

* **盾牌** :  这就像是在洛卡杰之喉首领战中的第一个BOSS的盾牌，当BOSS血量分别降至90%，60%和30%时，他会举起手来，盾牌将在他周围旋转。唯一消除盾牌的方法是杀死它。在这个阶段，团队每次受到伤害都会变得更加激烈，直到达到高峰，然后将持续对每个玩家造成伤害。每个玩家都有自己的AOE范围，必须不重叠，否则它们当然会同时对多个玩家造成伤害（每个玩家有自己的AOE范围，重叠会增加伤害，相当简单）。

这个技巧就是要让团队沿着形成的BOSS进行绕圈，治疗师持续治疗，团队尽可能地造成伤害。一旦盾牌被移除，战斗就像平常一样继续。

**注意：** 这个盾牌有一定的血量，你的DPS不必太高，但是如果你要花费很长时间，你的治疗师需要努力维持你的生命值。所以越快越好（我用坦克杀死它的视频！哈哈）。





### 库乔·科斯巴

> KUJO KETHBA


**KUJO KETHBA（CATBAT）**

说明：这是关于游戏中一个叫做"Kujo Kethba"或"Catbat"的Boss的攻略。

注意：请注意不要翻译html标签两个<>之间的内容。

欢迎来到地下城中最惊险的团队战斗！这个BOSS看起来比实际难度要高得多。良好的协调能够解决所有团队的问题。坦克负责吸收伤害，DPS输出伤害，治疗保持队友生命值！听起来很简单，但你会发现……

坦克应该将首领转离队伍朝向楼梯，永远不要让他转回来。始终背对着队伍。

输出应该分别宣称左侧和右侧（每个人分别宣称一个），而治疗师智慧地声称中间的横向排列为爆发的地方。在拉BOSS之前决定谁去哪里。

* **Eruptions** :  这个首领会猛地朝地面砸下，他所受到的所有伤害都会反弹并打到整个团队身上，同时他也会免疫伤害。这个阶段持续20秒。

这种情况会在90%、70%、50%和30%时发生，但如果你造成的伤害比较慢，它也会每30秒使用一次这个能力。

当这件事情发生时，间歇泉会喷发出熔岩，不断地击中小组直到20秒结束或所有玩家都死亡。同时需要注意的是，要躲避格伦德伍尔夫和巨人的攻击，避开幽灵的出现并运用横劈等技能来消灭它们。在谜城遗迹中，尼撒兹达和乌恩也是需要注意的对手，阿克和恩更是强大的boss角色，要小心应对。

停止这种情况发生的方法是让你的DPS玩家在左右两侧攻击方块，以掩盖熔岩喷涌。一旦它们被掩盖，石像鬼将不再免疫！在这个阶段，治疗师应该完全集中精力保持DPS的生命值，同时他们在执行任务。非常简单但很容易出错。专注。

* **攻略翻译
Adds** :  首领会在房间里召唤大量的小怪，它们会定身、施放技能、造成大范围伤害和其它各种糟糕的事情。当首领引起火山爆发时，这种情况会在每个阶段都发生。坦克应该尽可能将它们拉到离首领最近的地方，并在小队处理间歇泉的时候控制它们。一旦小队成功通过这个阶段，就应该全力处理小怪，否则机制的重叠将使房间里的小怪数量过多，难以应对。

* **重型攻击** :  这是游戏中对坦克最简单的技能。这个重型攻击需要你进行格挡。如果你不进行格挡，你就会受到巨大的伤害。然而，DPS职业需要进行翻滚才能躲避这个攻击，否则他们就会被击杀。在和Grundwulf、Ghost和Dragon等强力敌人战斗时特别要注意这个技能的使用。在Ruins of Mazzatun中，你会遇到En和Grundwulf这样的敌人，他们都很强大，需要谨慎对待。此外，在与Giant战斗时，你需要使用Cleave攻击。在与Ghost和Nisaazda战斗时，你需要使用Un和Za这两种技能。最后，在与Ak战斗时，请选择合适的技能和配合团队进行攻击。

* **Cleave** : 首领偶尔会使用横劈攻击，团队绝不能待在首领的面前。这是为了让坦克吸收攻击。如果dps/治疗师被攻击到，他们很可能会被秒杀。团队需要始终待在首领的后方。 

Note: 对于已知专有名词的翻译已经在上文中给出。





### 尼撒兹达

> NISAAZDA


**尼撒兹达与格伦德伍尔夫**

这个首领可以很简单，但在杂鱼团队中会有些混乱。如果你已经到了这一步，那么许多机制应该已经很熟悉了，但很重要的一点是要注意它们。此外，这是一场非常移动的战斗。坦克应该试图将近战堆叠在远程首领之上，以保持简单，然后可以将伤害均匀分配到两个首领身上，但如果不可能，请确保你始终同时引导两个首领。最重要的是，如果你必须单独选择一个目标，尽量集中攻击Nisaazda。一旦她倒下来，战斗就很容易了。

* **Fus Ro DAH** :  格伦德伍尔夫会用 Fus Ro DAH！大喊，同时直线冲刺，对任何被困在其中的人造成巨大的伤害。这非常容易看到。只要不要站在里面，但如果你被困住了，请务必阻挡。

* **重击** :  格伦德伍尔夫会向拥有敌意的目标（应该是坦克）发动重击攻击。如果你不格挡，你将会死亡。然而，如果你是DPS或治疗角色，你需要及时闪避此攻击，因为你无法生存地阻挡它。

* **攻略翻译
瞬移** :  尼撒兹达不会静止不动。她会从房间的一侧瞬移到另一侧，要时刻关注她的位置。通常在瞬移之后，会触发一些机制，因为你与她隔得太远了！

* **「聚能攻击」** :  Nisaazda 会施放聚能攻击，向团队快速射击，必须打断。

* **幽灵** :  主持应该被坦克嘲讽，它们只有在有人用红色血红蛋白球打击它们时才能被击败。如果它们没有被红球降低防御能力，它们是无敌的。

* **上古卷轴在线攻略

血之圆圈** :  在战斗期间，一个巨大的红色血圈将被释放到房间里。不惜一切代价远离它并让BOSS远离。如果你接触它，你将承受巨大的伤害，如果BOSS接触它，他们将造成高伤害（激怒）。 

注意：Grundwulf => 格伦德伍尔夫，Ghost => 幽灵，Dragon => 龙，Za => 扎，Ruins of Mazzatun => 谜城遗迹，En => 恩，Giant => 巨人，Cleave => 横劈，Ghost => 鬼魂，Nisaazda => 尼撒兹达，Un => 乌恩，Ak => 阿克，Nisaazda => 尼撒兹达。

* **攻略翻译如下

石像鬼** :  尼撒兹达会尝试进行一种完全不同类型的引导，这种引导无法被常规的“打断”类型的移动/技能中断。相反，你必须用红色的血红蛋白球来击中她并阻止她这样做。如果你没有这样做，她会生成一个相当大的石像鬼。如果发生这种情况，坦克必须迅速嘲讽它，你需要集中火力攻击它。如果它逃脱了，它会融化玩家！

**TIP:** 保持与Boss的距离不远，打断其技能释放，频繁攻击红色轨迹并迅速击败尼撒兹达，让战斗尽早结束并变得简单易行。





### 格伦德伍尔夫

> GRUNDWULF


**格伦德伍尔夫**

该攻略针对的是游戏 Elder Scrolls Online 中的 "格伦德伍尔夫" BOSS。

你终于来到了最终Boss，以为你要打一只龙？错了！

你的任务是打败那个正在杀死幽灵、从一条龙身上吸取力量变得更加强大的格伦德伍尔夫！这个困难模式看起来不像表面上那么难，但需要练习一段时间才能理解发生了什么。

坦克应该嘲讽Boss并让它保持尽可能靠中心的位置，以保持简单。始终将Boss的面对群体的方向。机制基本上是反复洗涤，但当Boss的血量降低时它们会变得更加繁重。所以重点是集中注意力。

治疗应该靠近坦克，但在BOSS后面（根据机制而定），DPS需要决定谁会拿血红蛋，并且什么时候拿。每个人都试图做同样的工作会搞砸。

* **Fus Ro Dah** :  这个boss会朝直线方向喊Fus Ro Dah!任何没有格挡（除了坦克）的人都会死亡。所以不要站在这个区域内（已知bug：有时候它仍然会伤及人群，因此即使你不在范围内，习惯性地格挡也是一个好习惯）。 

注：Fus Ro Dah是Elder Scrolls游戏中的一个著名口号，由游戏中一个角色使用，可以造成震荡并将敌人击飞。

游戏

一旦喊叫结束，地面上将出现三个圆圈，每个圆圈都会出现一个幽灵。它们免疫伤害，坦克应该把它们都放在Boss身边。

提示：这些敌人可以通过攻击血红蛋击败，但现在先暂缓攻击。

* **巨型蝙蝠 困难难度** :  这个BOSS会朝一个玩家的脚上方伸出手并在一个随机玩家（不是坦克）下生成一个小的范围提示。拥有这个提示的玩家需要立刻逃跑！但是，请不要惊慌。一个巨型蝙蝠将会生成并立刻击杀你，但是如果你只需绕着坦克跑（不要离BOSS太近），那么蝙蝠将会一直跟着你绕圈圈。

我们靠近坦克，让蝙蝠靠近幽灵（蝙蝠也有免疫能力）。

现在你已经把幽灵和蝙蝠引到房间了，派一个玩家去触发血红蛋白协同技能，并重击那个球！

如果做得正确，蝙蝠和所有的幽灵都会变得脆弱，蝙蝠会立即死亡，幽灵会开始受到已经运行中的任何东西的伤害。

* **攻略翻译如下

Hoavar** :  当你使用重攻击攻击红色的血红蛋白球时，会生成一个 hoavar，跟随玩家并降低其效果/诅咒，看起来像是一个空血条，上面有一个伤害盾。

现在你必须恢复满血才能移除它，或者死亡。这很像云之巅。不要接近霜巨人的脸，尽快击败它。当然，诀窍是让它跑到团队里，同时你攻击boss，它可以被持续伤害击杀，但我建议集中攻击它。

每当你攻击这个红色球体时，这就是你的优先目标！

* **攻略翻译如下

枷锁** :  开始时，会随机选择一名玩家，一根尖刺会从地面上冒出来，连接该玩家的身体并不断对其造成伤害，同时生成一个凝血者（小怪）。

受影响的玩家必须尽快到达尖刺。如果不在尖刺周围的圆圈内，则无法被治疗！留在尖刺旁直到它消失并且你不再被束缚。

在战斗中，这些问题将变得更加棘手，需要具备协调能力和注意力。战斗时间越长（或者boss的剩余健康值越少），这些问题就会越严重，首先出现一个，然后两个，再然后三个，最终出现四个。在生命值较低时，每个玩家将有一个束缚机制，导致你们四个人都需要快速到达自己的位置，并且需要4倍的凝血剂。

因此关键是到达您的目的地，并且重新聚集在中间并杀死凝血物。

* **火焰圈** :  首领会在玩家身下施放多个火焰圈，所以小心不要到处奔跑，你越乱跑，这些圈子就会越乱。它们不会造成巨大的伤害，但你要尽可能找到圈子之间的空隙。

* **龙之火** :  该BOSS会躲在房间中央的方块后面，龙会试图对他喷火。当发生这种情况时，请走出火圈，并攻击方块将其挪开（建议使用重攻击，因为你只能打一次）。

如果你没能完成这个机制，火势就会蔓延并且伤害会扩散到整个房间，你们全都会死亡。

* **格挡投掷** :  首领会将方块抛到空中以重新定位它，如果它落在你身上，你就会死亡，所以要小心观察它落在哪里。

* **恐喙鱼人小怪** :  这些小怪会根据生命值百分比出现，需要尽快处理。我建议为它们保留终极技能。坦克必须立即嘲讽它们，并将它们背向团队。

它们大约会在生命值达到70%、50%、30%、20%、10% 的时候出现。

**提示：**让幽灵保持无敌状态，直到蝙蝠出现并一起将它们用红色珠子击败。每次组队时都要带上hoavar和coagulant。将终极技能留给小怪。此游戏没有执行机制，没有激怒，只需重复以上步骤即可。

清晰的专注和协调能够完成任务。祝你好运！

> 
> This is the first pug killer of the dungeon surprisingly. Although it is only the first boss it does teach you some heavy lessons early on, introducing one of the most important mechanics for the whole dungeon as well as reminding you of some familiar mechanics if you ever did Aetherian Archive Or Ruins Of Mazzatun. This boss is quite mobile occasionally and the tank will have to keep it turned away from the boss as much as possible so that it's default movement mechanic can be controlled. OR people will just have to watch their feet!
> 
> **Ground stomp** - The boss will continuously bang on the ground causing aoe damage. The damage is not that high and the tank is only really the one at threat here but keep up damage as and when as dps and make sure the heals stay consistent while this is happening.
> 
> **Rock throw/Sit Down** - The boss will become immune and every second throw rocks at the group. These rocks are the same as the mechanic in Aetherian Archive and Ruins Of Mazzatun where you basically must BLOCK to avoid being knocked down and taking HUGE damage.
> 
> There are two ways to break this. You can either heal like hell and let it run it's course. OR you can go over to the yellow pads, synergies them and then heavy attack the red orbs that come out in the direction of the boss to remove the shield.
> 
> If done correctly he will stand up again and the fight will continue.
> 
> **Warning:** taking the synergy removes 50% of your health so be sure you are not low health at the time! Taking the synergy AND getting hit with the rock will kill you.
> 
> **Rock Slide (choo choo!)** - After standing up the boss will face in the direction he is agroed towards and basically steam train in a straight line across the room. If you get caught in this you will be run over and killed. Stay out of the path of the boss.
> 
> **Adds** - After and around the invulnerability phases the room will fill up with adds. You should make it your priority to deal with these fast so you do not get overwhelmed by them. Some will require interrupts and some avoiding aoes, but be sure as the tank you stack them up, and as dps and healers you do NOT run around the room in circles. Pace yourself and manage them.
> 
> 
> 
> DRO'ZAKAR
> 
> 
> **DRO'ZAKAR (VMOL FLASH BACK!)**
> 
> This boss can go very well or can be a complete mess. It is relatively straight forward for most but co-ordination during certain phases is very important so that people don't kill each other. The boss should be tanked turned AWAY from the group at all times!
> 
> **Siphon Hemoglobin** - Throughout the fight adds will come into the room and expose the Hemoglobin orbs (which you can also do yourself with a synergy). These adds will explode when the orb is exposed as they sacrifice themselves (in the video they were bugged and stuck in the door). When the Orbs are exposed the boss will try to channel from them. You MUST heavy attack the orb and get rid of it. If you do not do it in time the room will explode in massive damage and you will wipe.
> 
> **Cleave** - The boss has a heavy attack and cleave mechanic and you MUST block this as the tank, a dps will die to it so be careful. Do not make the boss face the group at any time because this will cause massive problems trying to find room to resurrect people it kills.
> 
> **Adds** - During the fight lots of basic trash adds will come into the room. The tank should try to stack these on the boss if possible and if your group dps is relatively low you should probably try to focus them over the boss. The ranged targets will require interrupts when they channel so be careful not to get stuck in the aoes they fire if you miss the interrupts.
> 
> **Adds** - Blood Puddle is much like the one in Spindleclutch II. The boss will transform into a puddle on the ground and follow the person whom last had agro (should be the tank) simply stand still and block this. the damage the puddle does will heal the boss, and while blocking the damage he can do is much less hence the heal being not so strong. This only lasts a few seconds but be careful as he usually comes out of it with a heavy attack.
> 
> **Shield** - This is just like the shield on the first boss in Maw Of Lorkhaj, at 90% ,60%, and 30% health, he will raise his hands and a shield will be spinning around him. The only way to remove it, is to kill it. During this phase the group will take damage every tick getting more aggressive until it peaks then will continuously do damage to each player. Each player has their own aoe and you must NOT overlap else they will of course do damage to more than one player at a time (each has their own, overlap increases damage, pretty simple).
> 
> The trick to this is to simply circle the boss formation wise, while the healer keeps healing and the group does as much damage as possible. Once the shield is removed, the fight continues as normal.
> 
> **NOTE:** this shield has a health amount, your dps doesn't have to be HIGH but if you are going to take a long time, your healer will need to work hard to keep you up. So the faster the better (video of me killing it with a tank! lol ).

> 
> Welcome to the biggest pug killer fight in the dungeon. This boss is really made to look a lot more complex than it actually is. Good discipline really fixes all the problems that are common for pugs in here. Tank tanks, dps does damage and healer heals! Sounds simple enough? You would think...
> 
> The tank should turn the boss away from the group facing the stairs and NEVER turn him around. Always face away from the group.
> 
> The dps should claim the left side and right side (one each) as theirs while the healer claims the middle formation wise for the eruptions. Decide who is going where before you pull the boss.
> 
> **Eruptions** - The boss will slam the ground and ALL damage he takes will reflect and hit the group and he will also be immune. This phase lasts 20seconds.
> 
> This happens at 90% 70% 50% and 30% but also if you are slow with the damage he will just do it every 30seconds.
> 
> While this is happening geysers will open up and lava will fly out of them hitting the group repeatedly until 20seonds is over or everyone is dead.
> 
> The way to STOP this happening is to make your dps players, left and right, attack the blocks to cover up the lava spurts. Once they are covered the gargoyle will be no longer immune! During this phase the healer should focus PURELY on keeping the dps alive while they are doing their job. Pretty simple but SO easy to mess up. Focus.
> 
> **Adds** - The boss spawns a HUGE amount of adds in the room, these root, channel abilities, have lots of aoe and every side of nasty you can imagine in an add pull. This happens each phase that he is causing the eruptions. The tank should pull these as close to the boss as possible and CC them while the group is managing with the geysers. Once they have successfully passed that phase, the group should focus fully on the adds else the overlap of mechanic will flood the room with way too many to manage.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The simplest mechanic in the game for a tank to put into practice�This heavy attack requires you to BLOCK. If you do not block you are you take huge damage. A dps however will have to dodge roll else it will kill them.
> 
> **Cleave** - The boss will occasionally hit with cleave like attacks and the group MUST NOT be in the bosses face. This is for the tank to suck up. If dps/healers get hit this will most likely kill them. The group needs to stay behind the boss at all times.
> 
> 
> 
> NISAAZDA
> 
> 
> **NISAAZDA & GRUNDWULF**
> 
> This Boss can be simple but also a bit messy in pugs. There are many mechanics that should already be familiar if you have gotten this far but it is very important that you pay attention to them. Also it is a very mobile fight. The tank should TRY to stack the melee on top of the ranged boss to keep things simple and damage can be then distributed to both bosses evenly, but if this is not possible just be sure that you have BOTH taunted at all times just in case. Above all if you had to chose a target individually. FOCUS Nisaazda as much as possible. Once she is down it is pretty easy.
> 
> **Fus Ro DAH!** - Grundwulf will shout Fus Ro DAH! and shout in a straight line doing huge damage to anyone caught inside of it. This is very easy to see. Simply don't stand in it but if you get caught, be sure to block.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Grundwulf will heavy attack whoever has aggro (should be the tank) Block this attack or you will die. If you are a dps or healer however you need to dodge roll it on time as you will not survive blocking it.
> 
> **Teleport** - Nisaazda does NOT stand still. She will teleport from one side of the room to the other, keep track of her at all times. Usually after a teleport, mechanics follow because you are so far away!
> 
> **Channeled attacks** - Nisaazda will cast channeled attacks that will fire rapid shots at the group which MUST be interrupted.
> 
> **Ghosts** - hosts should be taunted by the tank and they can ONLY be killed if someone hits them with a red Hemoglobin Orb. They are invulnerable if they are not debuffed by the red orb.
> 
> **Blood circle** - During the fight a MASSIVE red circle of blood will be cast into the room. Stay out of this at all costs and keep the BOSS out of it. If you touch it you will take huge damage, and if the boss touches it they will DEAL large damage (enrage).
> 
> **Gargoyle** - Nisaazda will try to do a completely different type of channeling which cannot be interrupted by the regular 'interrupt' type movements/abilities. Instead you MUST hit her with the red Hemoglobin orb and stop her doing it. If you do not, you will make her spawn a rather large gargoyle. If this happens the tank must taunt it fast and you need to focus it down. If this runs loose it will melt through players!
> 
> **TIP:** Keep the bosses close, stay on interrupts, hit the red orb often and kill Nisaazda fast so the fight gets much less complicated sooner.
> 
> 
> 
> GRUNDWULF
> 
> 
> **GRUNDWULF**
> 
> You finally made it to the final boss and think you are here to fight a dragon? NOPE!
> 
> You are here to fight someone who is KILLING one, siphoning power from a dragon has made Grundwulf MUCH stronger! This Hard mode is not as bad as it first looks on the surface but will take a bit of practice to understand what is going on.
> 
> The tank should taunt the boss and keep him as central as possible to keep things simple. ALWAYS face the boss away from the group. The mechanics are pretty much rinse repeat but they do get a lot heavier when health goes lower. So focus is key.
> 
> The healer should stay close to the tank but behind the boss (depending on mechanics) and the dps will need to decide who is going to get the Hemoglobin orb and when. Everyone trying to do the same job will mess it up.
> 
> **Fus Ro Dah** - The boss will shout Fus Ro Dah! in a straight line. Anyone caught by this not blocking (apart from tank) is dead. so do NOT stand in this (known bug: sometimes it hits people anyway, make it a habit to block even if you are OUT of it).
> 
> Once the shout is over 3 circles will be on the ground and a ghost will come out of each one. These are immune to damage and the tank should position them all on the boss.
> 
> **NOTE:** These can be made vulnerable by hitting the Hemoglobin orb, BUT hold back for now).
> 
> **Giant bat!! (hard mode)** - The boss will cast at a player aiming his hand at their feet and a small aoe notification will spawn under a random player (not the tank). Whoever has this needs to run NOW! However, do not panic. A giant bat will spawn and one shot you but if you simply run in a circle around the tank (without getting too close to the boss) the bat will just follow you round and round.
> 
> We stay close to the tank so that the bat is close to the ghosts (the bat is also immune).
> 
> Now that you have the ghosts AND the bat in the room, send one player to go and hit the Hemoglobin synergy and heavy attack the orb!
> 
> If done correctly, the bat and all of the ghosts will be vulnerable, the bat will die instantly and the ghosts will start to take damage from anything already running.
> 
> **Hoavar!** - When you heavy attack the red Hemoglobin orb, a hoavar will spawn and follow a player debuffing/cursing them with a horrible effect that will look like an empty health bar with a damage shield on it.
> 
> You must now heal to FULL to remove it, or die. much like in Cloudrest. Stay out of the hoarvar's face and kill it asap. The trick of course is to let it run into the group while you have damage running on the boss and it can die to passive damage but i would suggest focusing it.
> 
> This is your priority target ANY time you hit that red orb!
> 
> **Shackle** - To start with ONE player will be chosen at random and a spike will appear out of the ground with a red chain attached to the chosen player. This shackles them to it and consistently causes them to take damage while spawning a coagulant (small add).
> 
> The player affected must get to the spike as fast as possible. Wile not inside the circle around the spike you cannot be healed! Stay with the spike until it is gone and you are no longer shackled.
> 
> During the fight these will become more of a problem where co-ordination and attention being paid are both important. The longer the fight (or less health the boss has) the more of these will spawn, first one then 2 then 3 then eventually 4. At low health there will be ONE shackle mechanic for EACH player, resulting in all 4 of you having to get to your locations fast AND having 4x coagulants.
> 
> So it is key you get to your locations and also key you regroup back in the middle and kill the coagulants.
> 
> **Fire circles** - The boss will cast multiple circles of fire under players so be careful not to run around too much, the more you run the more scattered these will be. These don't do MASSIVE damage, but you want to try to find gaps in these if you can.
> 
> **Dragon Fire** - The boss will hide behind the block in the middle of the room and the dragon will try to breath in his face. when this happens, get OUT of the fire and attack the block to move it out of the way (i would recommend a heavy attack as you can only hit it ONCE).
> 
> If you fail this mechanics the fire will spread the damage throughout the room and you will all die.
> 
> **Block throw** - The boss will throw the block in the air to reposition it, if it lands on you, you are dead so be careful to watch for where it lands.
> 
> **Dire-Maw Adds** - These adds spawn at health percentages and should be dealt with as fast as possible, i would recommend saving ultiamtes for these. The tank must taunt them asap and turn them away from the group.
> 
> They spawn at around 70% 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%.
> 
> **TIPS:** Keep the ghosts invulnerable until the bat comes out and red orb them all at once together. Always bring the hoavar and coagulant's into the group. And save ultimates for the adds. There is NO execute mechanic, no enrage just rinse repeat.
> 
> Clean focus and co-ordination will get the job done. GOOD LUCK!!
