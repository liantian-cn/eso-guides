### 尖牙巨蛇

> Fanged Menace


** 长牙威胁 **

这个BOSS会立即打破随机队伍。如果你明白“不要站在蠢货里”的话，机制非常简单。但很多时候，玩家常常对那些认为他们可以很轻松地完成任务的人缺乏注意而感到沮丧。所以最重要的提示是，注意脚下！

* **蛇人** :  这个房间里满是蛇人敌人，坦克需要吸引BOSS的注意力，也需要尽快将所有小怪聚集在一起，以便能够尽可能地消灭他们。他们的生命值不是很高，但数量很多。它们会释放重击和技能/尖叫声，可以被打断，因此每个人都应该保持警惕。注意：不要把小怪聚在BOSS身边...在BOSS卷曲的情况下，将它们拉到一边。

* **鞭子** :  这是一个非常大的前方范围攻击，Boss会用尾巴向持有仇恨者的方向进行鞭打（应该是坦克）。如果你身处其中，你应该要么格挡它，要么闪避出来。最简单的方法是让坦克将Boss面朝远离团队的方向，并让团队保持在它后面以避免受到伤害。如果没有被格挡，你将被击退。在此之前和之后，有时会有一个恶心的重击，所以要小心。

* **毒蛇盘绕** :  小心脚下！这个机制非常关键，需要人们集中注意力。首领将卷成一团，会施放一个巨大的毒圈。我不需要告诉你要远离它，因为显然它会造成伤害，然而它还有一个主要的问题……如果你站在毒圈内，每个毒药效果会以每秒5%的速度治愈首领，这可能会是一场噩梦，要远离毒圈。只需稍微向后退一步，远程攻击。





### 风暴加纳卡顿

> Ganakton the Tempest


这是一款名为《上古卷轴在线》的游戏。以下是

** GANAKTON THE TEMPEST **

** GANAKTON THE TEMPEST ** 这个标志表示玩家遇到了名为“暴风之神甘纳克顿”的boss。

这个首领非常简单，但是能造成很大的伤害。因此需要注意自己的位置。坦克应该将首领固定在一个位置上，不要绕圈而是站在原地。小组中的每个成员也应该在一个整洁的队形中找到自己的位置，这样当首领随机转身时，很容易看到是谁被瞄准了。四处奔跑或者密集站在一起都是无济于事的。

* **闪电吐息** :  这个攻击将瞄准仇恨目标，因此务必确保坦克在嘲讽，如果它瞄准了输出或治疗角色，你可以通过站到一边来躲开，他在释放时不会移动或旋转。这是一种闪电吐息攻击，可以毁灭一个脆弱的角色，所以要小心。坦克应该格挡或简单地移动一下，然后在攻击结束后回到原来的位置。它持续约4秒，每秒造成一定的伤害。

* **闪电波** :  位置非常重要。每个人都应该有自己专门应对这个机制的空间。它会随机瞄准小队中的一个成员，并朝他们发射地面AOE，这会造成闪电伤害，并且接触后他会用直接伤害的闪电攻击攻击，这可能会使同一目标(不要堆叠)，如果你很快，你可以躲开波浪，但如果不是，则盾牌/格挡可以防止大量伤害。注意，这是快速攻击。但是，如果它看着你，你就知道轮到你避免它了(因此要保持自己的位置，堆叠会使人们无法确定谁是目标，会有多个人被攻击)。

* **电击脉冲** :  它会定期释放一个大型脉冲技能，对所有团队成员造成少量闪电伤害并短暂震晕他们，这是无法避免的，但当然可以通过抵抗来缓解一些。如果你的治疗师非常好或者你有护盾，这不会造成太大问题，但一定要注意不要让自己的健康状况降得太低，因为与其他机制混合在一起，可能会成为一个问题。





### 歌者斯里克尼娅

> Sliklenia the Songstress


**歌者斯里克尼娅**

这段攻略一开始会让人感到困惑，因为通常情况下你会被告知要“先击杀小怪”。但在这种情况下则不然。首先，BOSS身边有一条宠物蛇，提示：不要杀死它。坦克应该嘲讽BOSS，并将蛇放置不管。

* **重击** :  这时你的坦克应该防御（或者是谁拥有仇恨）如果你没有防御，她会将你击倒，并且之后她会跟上一些轻攻击，这会很痛苦。坦克更不容易被杀死，但持续输出或治疗的队友可能会死亡。如果你被攻击到了，确保你正在防御这个攻击。坦克应该将Boss转向群体的另一面，以确保他们不会受到她的伤害。

* **尖叫** :  这是一个非常有趣的机制，但最重要的是你不应该杀死小蛇宠物的原因。

在战斗中，歌者斯里克尼娅会跑到一个位置并不断尖叫，对所有玩家造成伤害，无论你在房间的哪个地方。不要像个无头苍蝇一样乱跑，你只会看起来很蠢而且会死。你需要做的是跟随机制。当她跑到她的位置时，蛇也会跑到另一个位置...找到蛇，你会发现它盘踞着并在自己周围创建了一个护盾。进入护盾内部，你将不会受到尖叫的任何伤害。你可以在护盾内部对她造成伤害。一旦尖叫结束，回到原位，反复执行这个步骤。

注意：在她死后不要忘记按压房间里的按钮，以降低下一场战斗的吊桥。





### 伊克斯尼雅夫人

> Matron Ixniaa


**伊克斯尼雅夫人**

这个首领相当简单，但攻击力极高。她身边有许多额外的蛇人，应该将它们全部站在/靠近首领旁，这样它们可以死于AOE伤害。DPS和治疗应在即将到来的机制中分散开来，并当然要注意打断。在房间里到处乱跑只会导致人员死亡，所以放松一点！

* **重击** :  简单而有效，你以前见过它们！确保坦克在BOSS身上有威胁仇恨，这个重击只需要<b>格挡</b>即可。如果你是DPS或治疗，同样适用，需要格挡。如果你不格挡，它会把你击倒并对你造成极大的伤害。如果它攻击了错误的目标，请<b>不要</b>四处跑，否则它会从后面杀死你。放松，格挡和恢复。

* **双重闪电喷溅** :  每10秒她会对小队随机的一个成员施放一次大规模的闪电攻击。这个攻击会形成两个范围效果，一个在中间，一个更大的在外围，两个基本上是重叠的。不要堆在一块，找到自己的位置。如果你被外围效果击中，你会活下来，但肯定会受到伤害，所以尽量躲避并使用翻滚来避免并立刻重新加入战斗。然而，如果你非坦克并且被困在中心范围内，你就会非常容易被秒杀。千万不要被中心圆圈击中。

### 远古木傀儡

> Ancient Lurcher


**远古树妖**

这个首领和地牢中的标准长笛手非常相似。他有一些重攻击和其他怪物一样的基本机制，但有些变化。坦克应该固定地控制这个首领，并且面向团队的另一侧，同时将任何其他敌人拉过来，以便使用AOE伤害杀死。团队应该在首领的背后/旁边找到自己的空间，避免集中在一起。注意打断和来自其他敌人的正面AOE攻击。

* **重击** :  基本的重击，附带击退效果。如果它攻击了你，请确保你使用格挡来减少受到的伤害。

* **摇动** :  在整个战斗中，你会注意到首领会不停地摇晃并在地面上抛出aoe，这些可以被打断，所以如果伤害击中地面，请留意你的脚并在看到它时进行打断。

* **光束** :  间或，boss会将一个绿色光束放在一个随机的玩家身上，吸取他们的生命值，你必须用盾牌/格挡/治疗来坚持下去，因为这会造成非常大的伤害！

* **Enrage** :  bos血量低于50%时，将会进行一次闪电冲刺，使其地面范围攻击非常强大。因此，请小心，不要长时间站在boss面前。如果你的治疗师注意到这个技能，那么这不应该是一个大问题，但是请保持警惕。同时，注意避免站在地面范围攻击范围内。





### 拉弥亚女王塞利斯特利克斯

> Sellistrix the Lamia Queen


**拉弥亚女王塞利斯特利克斯**

在科林涅姆堡垒中的最终Boss非常棘手，虽然如果你有经验有许多方法来应对它，但是它是有规律的，遵循机制并控制战斗节奏就可以简单应对。坦克应始终保持控制，但是小组应处于一种形态，让他们都可以在Boss附近拥有自己的空间。她会进行随机攻击，你需要看到谁被攻击到了。

* **引导打击** :  这是她的主要攻击，她会举起手来，召唤数个范围伤害，对场地中某些岛屿造成持续伤害。如果掌控得当，这非常简单。坦克应该将她放在（是的，放在而不是靠近）其中一个岛屿上。当她释放这个技能时，所有人都进入水中。等技能结束后，所有人再回到战斗中。如果你想让这次尝试顺畅进行，请一直让她待在岛上。

* **重击** :  基础重击可以致人倒地，必须格挡。不要在房间里到处奔跑，否则她不但会背后杀死你，还会发生更糟糕的事情。注意防守。 

注：其中Len、En、Song、Ri、Ger、Ak为人物名字、地名或种族名等专有名词；Sliklenia the Songstress、Matron Ixniaa、Lamia、Lamia Queen、Sellistrix the Lamia Queen、Arx Corinium为地点或角色名。

* **上古卷轴在线游戏

冲锋** :  女王经常会攻击随机玩家，所以要小心，但如果你离得太远，她会冲向试图逃离的玩家。不要在房间里四处乱跑，靠近女王。同时，她的一些攻击是可以躲避的，避免承受过多伤害。值得注意的是，战斗时可以利用控场技能或者合作进行击杀，提高胜算。对于团队而言，最好制定统一的攻击策略，提前分配好各自的任务和位置，确保稳妥。

* **尖叫** :  塞利斯特利克斯通常会向坦克的方向尖叫，但请注意。如果嘲讽掉了并且她转向小队成员之一，她已经开始移动并会向嘲讽掉时所站立的方向尖叫。这意味着她会冲着DPS和/或治疗尖叫！这是一次毁灭性的攻击，大多数人无法承受。你的坦克需要坚持嘲讽，如果她冲向你，请格挡并抵御，让治疗师尽力治疗，或者试着通过移动/翻滚来躲闪。这会产生一个击退效果，会使你失去平衡，非常危险。

注意：远离并不意味着在房间里乱跑，如果她变得失控，你会杀死所有人。

* **伤害护盾** :  塞利斯特利克斯将在大部分的战斗中拥有伤害护盾，并会持续进行重新施加。这意味着当她拥有护盾时，直接造成的伤害不会暴击。这会使得战斗时间变长，但这是比较安全的方式。

* **带电的水** :  这个很关键。如果她碰到水，她会不停地电死它。这意味着任何站在水中的人每秒钟都会受到大量伤害，很可能无法生存。所以始终让她待在小岛上可以避免出现这种机制，当Channeled Strikes释放AOE攻击时，你当然可以利用水区域。一定要让她保持静止！

* **经验丰富的方法（注高风险）** :  只有在你非常有经验时才能这样做...

与其将她留在岛上并不断进出范围技能来保持干净（但她有伤害护盾），还可以采用更难的战术。

如果你的坦克可以将Boss定位在水里，而你们都在岛上，那么她会电击水（这意味着你们永远不能碰它），并消除自己的伤害护盾。这意味着"暴击来了！"这是一个更快地击败吉勒的方法，但需要高度协调。我不建议新的团队使用此方法，但如果你能掌握它，这将很有趣并且快速。

> This boss is an INSTANT pug (pick up group) breaker. The mechanics are extremely simple if you understand 'don't stand in stupid' BUT all too often players are constantly frustrated with the lack of attention payed by people thinking they can just yolo. SO the biggest tip for this is, WATCH YOUR FEET!
> 
> **Lamias** - This room is FULL of Lamia type enemies and while the tank needs to keep the attention of the boss he/she ALSO needs to position all of the adds together as soon as possible so that they can be dispatched with as much aoe damage as possible. They do not have a huge amount of health but there are a lot of them. They fire off heavy attacks and abilities/screams that can be interrupted, so everyone should be on their toes. NOTE: do NOT stack the adds on the boss... pull them to one side in case the boss coils.
> 
> **Whip** - This is very large frontal aoe attack where the boss will tail whip in the direction of whoever has  the agro (Should be the tank) If you are inside of this you should either block it, or dodge roll out of it. The simplest way is for the tank to position the boss facing away from the group while the group stay behind to avoid it. If not blocked you WILL be knocked backwards. Before and after this sometimes comes a nasty heavy attack so be careful.
> 
> **Poison Coil** - WATCH YOUR FEET! This mechanic is crucial and requires people to pay attention. The boss will coil up in a ball and a LARGE poison aoe will be placed. I shouldn't need to tell you to stay out of it since it is clearly going to hurt, however it has a major additional problem... IF you stand inside of it, every tick of poison will HEAL the boss at about 5% per second, which can be a nightmare, stay OUT of the poison. just step back a bit and wait while damaging from range.

> 
> This boss is very simple, but can hurt. So attention must be paid to position. The tank should hold the boss in one position, do not run around in circles just stand still. Each member of the group should also find their own position in a clean formation so when the boss randomly turns it is VERY easy for people to see WHO is targeted. Running around or stacking up will NOT help!
> 
> **Lightning Breath** - This attack will be aimed at whoever has the agro so be sure the tank is taunting, failing that if it aims at a dps of healer you can get OUT of it by moving to one side, he doesn't move or spin while this is channeling. This is a lightning breath attack which can devastate a squishy so BE careful. The tank should block or simple move a bit and then get back into position when it is gone. It lasts about 4 seconds and ticks each second with damage.
> 
> **Lightning wave** - Position is KEY. Everyone should have their own space for this mechanic specifically. He will aim randomly at a member of the group and fire a ground aoe in a straight light at them, this does lightning damage and straight after it connects he will hit with a direct damage lightning attack which can  stun the same target (don't stack), if you are quick you can move out of the wave, but if not then shields/blocking can prevent a large amount of the damage. Note this is a FAST attack. But if he looks at YOU, you know it's your turn to avoid it (hence staying in your own positions, stacking makes it impossible to tell who is the target and more than one person will get hit).
> 
> **Shock Pulse** - Every so often he will emit a large PULSE ability which does a small amount of lightning damage and will briefly stun ALL of group members, this is unavoidable but of course can be somewhat mitigated with resists, If your healer is on point or you have shields this wont cause much of a problem but be sure not to dip too low health wise because mixed with the other mechanics it can be an issue.

> This is very misleading at first because in general you are told in most situations to 'kill the adds first'. Well not in this case. She has a pet snake, tip: DON'T kill it. The tank should taunt the boss and leave the snake alone.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is where your tank should be blocking (or whoever has agro at the time) if you miss the block she WILL knock you down and it can be a pain as she follows up with some light attacks afterwards. A tank will be less easy to kill but a dps or a healer will probably die. make sure you are blocking this if it is on you. The tank should be turning the boss AWAY from the group to make sure they are not facing her damage anyway.
> 
> **SCREAM!** - A very fun mechanic but above all the reason why you should NOT kill the little snake pet.
> 
> During the fight Sliklenia will run to a location and scream constantly doing damage to all players no matter where you are in the room. Do NOT run around like a headless chicken, you will just look stupid and die. What you need to do is follow the mechanic. When She ran to her location, the SNAKE also ran to another location..find the snake, you will see that it is coiled up and created a shield over itself. Get inside the shield and you will take ZERO damage from the scream. You can damage her from inside the shield. Once the screaming is over, get back into position and rinse repeat.
> 
> NOTE: after she is dead don't forget to press the button in the room to lower the drawbridge to the next fight.

> 
> This boss is pretty simple but hits like a TRUCK. She has many additional Lamias along side her and these should all be positioned around/on the boss so they can die to aoe damage. The dpos and healer should spread out for the upcoming mechanics and of course be aware of interrupts. Running around the room will do nothing but kill people, so RELAX!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Simple yet effective, you've seen them before! Make sure the tank has agro on the boss and this heavy attack coming in should simply be BLOCKED. If you are a dps or a healer and this is on you, same applies, block it. If you don't it will knock you down and hurt like hell. IF she is on the wrong person do NOT run around the room, she will just kill you in the back of the head. Relax, block and recover.
> 
> **Double Lightning Splash** - Every 10 seconds she will call down a large blast of lightning on a random member of the group. This has 2x aoe circles, one in the middle and a larger one overall, basically one on top of the other. DO NOT stack up. find your own space. If you are hit by the outer aoe you will survive but it WILL hurt. So try to dodge roll or move out of it and then get straight back in again and continue fighting. IF however you are anything BUT the tank and you are caught in the MIDDLE aoe, you have a very high chance to get one shot and die! Do NOT get hit by the middle circle.

> 
> This boss is very similar to the standard lurchers in the dungeon. He has some heavy attacks and basic mechanics that the others have with a couple of alterations. The tank should hold this boss very still and face him AWAY from the group, while pulling in any additional enemies so they can be killed with aoe damage. The group should position themselves in their own space behind/beside the boss to avoid stacking. Pay attention to interrupts and frontal aoe from the adds.
> 
> **Slam** - Basic heavy attack with knockback attached to it. Be sure you BLOCK this if it is on you as it can do quite a lot of damage.
> 
> **Shake!** - Throughout the fight you will notice the boss shaking and throwing ground aoe's all over, this can be interrupted, so watch your feet if the damage hits the ground and interrupt when you see it.
> 
> **Beam** - Occasionally the boss will put a green beam on a random player draining their life, you must shield/bloc/heal through this as it hurts a LOT!
> 
> **Enrage** - Under 50% health the boss will enrage with a lightning charge. When this happens his ground aoe gets MUCH stronger, so be weary and don't stand in his face too long. If your healer is on point this shouldn't be much of a problem but pay attention none the less.

> The final boss in Arx Corinium is a tricky one and although there are many ways to do this if you are experienced, there ARE rules that apply to the boss and it can be controlled SIMPLY by following mechanics and pacing the fight. The tank should keep agro at all times but the group should be in a formation that allows them to all have their own space CLOSE to the boss. She will do random attacks and you NEED to see who is being hit.
> 
> **Channeled Strikes** - This is her main attack, she will raise her hands and call down several AOE blasts which do damage over time to certain islands in the area. This is VERY simple if controlled.The tank should hold her ON (yes on not near) one of the islands. When she fires off this ability, everybody get in the water. When it finishes, everyone get back into the fight. KEEP her on the island at ALL times if you want this to be a smooth run.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - Basic heavy attack which can knock down, this MUST be blocked, don't run around the room, not only will she kill you in the back of the head, WORSE things happen.
> 
> **Charge** - Very often she will attack a random player, so be careful of this, however if you are TOO far away she will charge the player trying to escape. DO NOT run around the room, stay close.
> 
> **Scream** - Sellistrix will scream usually in the direction of the tank BUT pay attention. IF the taunt is dropped and she spins onto one of the group members, she is ALREADY on motion and will scream in the direction she was last standing in when the taunt dropped. This means that she will scream AT a dps and/or healer! This is a devastating attack that most cannot stand up to. Your tank needs to STAY on that taunt, and if this does face you either block and shield while the healer works hard OR try to get out of it by moving/dodge rolling. This does a knock back and will put you off balance so this is VERY dangerous.
> 
> NOTE: moving away does NOT mean run around the room, you will kill everyone if she goes rogue.
> 
> **Damage shield** - Sellistrix has a damage shield on her for the majority of the fight which she consistently reapplies. This means direct damage will not critical strike while she has the shield. This makes the fight a bit longer but that is the SAFE way to do it.
> 
> **Charged water** - This is Crucial. IF she touches the water, she will constantly electrecute it. Meaning ANYONE standing in water will take MASSIVE damage every tick and most likely will NOT survive. SO keeping her on the island at all times allows you to never have this mechanic happen and of course mean that you can utilize the water area when the aoes land from Channeled strikes. Hold her STILL!
> 
> **EXPERIENCED METHOD (note: High risk)** - ONLY do this if you are VERY experienced...
> 
> Rather than keeping her on the island and moving in and out with the aoe's to keep it clean(but she has a damage shield) there is a more difficult tactic that can be applied.
> 
> 'IF' your tank can position the boss so that SHE is in the water, but YOU are all on the island. She will zap the water (meaning you must NOT touch it ever) and remove her own damage shield. This means 'crits are IN!'. It is a faster way to kill ger but requires HIGH co-ordination. I would NOT recommend this for new groups but if you can nail it, it is fun and fast.
