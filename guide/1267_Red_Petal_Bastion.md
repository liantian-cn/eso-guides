## 红花堡





### 群鸦怨灵

> WRAITH OF CROWS


** 乌鸦之魂（秘密首领） **



* **第一波出现了3个小怪接下来会有5-6个小怪** ： 坦克应该确保将它们全部控制并聚在一起，而且转身背对着小队。一旦它们被消灭，你就要开始与首领战斗了。

* **黑乌鸦风暴** :  BOSS会随机挑选一名玩家，并向其施放乌鸦风暴AOE，如果你站在其中，就会立即死亡，因此你需要躲开（避开它）并与团队拉开距离，直到它消失。注意不要影响其他队员。

* **暗黑箭** :  首领会施放几乎与黑暗魔法相关的技能，每个玩家周围都会出现一个快速爆炸并造成伤害的技能。通过移动或者用格挡来躲避这些技能。





### 狡猾的洛格兰


这个首领看起来比实际要混乱得多，但取决于你想要多难。如果你按照基本机制操作，这个首领就不难应对，否则你可能会被压倒。这个首领的诀窍是要清除房间里的任何小怪。做到这一点，你们将使这场战斗容易 10 倍。

* **坦克应将BOSS放在房间中央或静态位置并将其保持不动会存在需要移动的机制但您应该能够大部分时间将其保持在同一区域内其中可能会出现以下内容**
    - 对付Ihudir（伊胡迪尔）时需注意不要被其变成山羊（Goat）；
    - 狡猾的洛格兰（Rogerain the Sly）和骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞（Prior Thierric Sarazen）等BOSS会在战斗中召唤出暗影（Shadow），需要小心应对；
    - 典狱长（Warden）BOSS会在战斗过程中进行多个机制。

* **大爆炸** :  这个非常简单，boss会在自己脚下施放一个巨大的范围攻击。简单地避免站在范围内即可。此外，范围内会发出最多8个个体范围攻击，并在团队地面上扇形散开。你只需要左右移动脚来躲避它们。这些机制所造成的击晕和伤害可能会相当棘手，所以请时刻注意这个持续攻击。在这个攻击期间要时刻保持警觉。

* **闪电之风** : 这个首领会在他前方释放小型闪电风暴，请格挡或躲避，它们造成的伤害不高，但在战斗中尽量减少受到的伤害会更安全！注意避免。

* **重击** :  非常简单，如果BOSS对坦克进行重击，请使用格挡。如果坦克由于某种原因失去了仇恨，并瞄准了DPS/治疗，则一定要躲避，否则就会死！

* **青蛙** :  在这场战斗中，首领会召唤青蛙！这些是普通的小怪，有小型范围攻击和直接攻击。为了减轻混乱的战斗方式并简化战斗，应尽快杀死它们。它们的生命值不高，可以被连锁或眩晕，所以在它们出现时一定要将它们作为首要目标。记住，太多叠加机制会导致问题，将它们清除掉！

* **毒物炸弹** :  这个BOSS会让多个小型和大型毒物炸弹在房间中飞行并随机降落在地上或玩家身上。当然，如果它们在地面上，请不要站在它们上面。如果它们瞄准了一个玩家，范围伤害将会扩散并爆炸。和许多其他地下城的寒冰彗星般的效果一样，这些需要在一个安全的开放空间内阻挡。不要把它们堆在一起。对于已知的专有名词，翻译如下：


* **达德拉门户** :  这些门户由BOSS生成，通常位于房间的角落，因此请保持警觉。当它们生成时，您需要将它们消灭掉。它们存在的时间越长，就会有越多的敌人从里面冲出来。总的来说，他们会刷出Flesh Atronachs（血肉元素）、Daedra Spiders（寰球恶魔蜘蛛）和Watchers（守望者）。这些必须被消灭，但是门户优先，首先要停止它们的出现。在这个地牢中添加物始终是主要目标，因此虽然您可以操纵它们的位置来同时与Boss作战，但仍应将所有添加物集中在Boss上。


* **无论花费多长时间，确保你完成这项任务，否则你将会被压倒。如果你不能及时摧毁传送门，另一个传送门就会生成，如此反复。这会让你的任务变得非常棘手。**

* **你成了山羊** :  没错！ Boss把你变成了山羊！一名玩家会在随机选中（通常不是坦克，除非掉了嘲讽），并且房间里会出现甜面包圈。作为山羊，你所要做的就是跑来跑去收集这些面包圈，以帮助团队。每个甜面包圈将帮助提升你的终极技能值、增加伤害、提高治愈效果，并且每收集一个能加一定的治疗效果。当计时器结束后，你将恢复原来的形态。另一个重要的优点是，如果你以山羊的形态冲向传送门，你会对它造成更多的伤害，并能避免在战斗中被它造成麻烦。

* **超难模式** :  这是基础的超难模式。战斗完全相同，但是敌人有更多的生命值和攻击力。挑战一下吧，你行的！





### 蜘蛛戴德拉（秘密Boss）


* **重击** :  这个机制很好理解，挡住它！

* **喷溅** :  首领随机选择一个玩家进行喷溅，完全类似于斯派德克拉奇一号副本中的最后一个BOSS。只要你们分散开来，就能看到她的目标。你们需要做的就是进行翻滚来避免它。其中有人会额外受到持续持续伤害，所以需要治疗他们。

* **「闪电」** :  每次会有两名玩家被闪电攻击。你有两个选择：闪避或格挡。决定权在你手中。注意避开或格挡，以避免受到伤害。游戏中的专有名词还包括：暗影摇篮、恩、莱姆、里、横劈、伊胡迪尔、吉勒、山羊、狡猾的洛格兰、骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞和典狱长。





### 神器乘器者

* **需要与三个敌人战斗。艾利恩・梅里克，莉拉明德尔，伊胡迪尔。**

* 这个Boss非常灵活！坦克应该尽可能地让Boss保持静止，同时试图将其瞄准远离团队，最好朝着一堵墙。Boss需要频繁地移动，因此一定要时刻保持嘲讽并且保持足够的资源，否则会变得棘手。其中一个Boss技能叫做"Cleave"，会对前方区域造成伤害，走到Boss的侧面会避免被攻击。留意其它技能，比如放置陷阱的"Ihudir"和追踪你的"Rogerain the Sly"。最后，如果你被阴影（"Shadow"）缠绕，尽快去躲避或解除效果。记得，典狱长（"Warden"）和骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞（"Prior Thierric Sarazen"）将帮助你击败这个Boss。

* **重击** :  坦克需要处理基础攻击，一定要格挡。

* **斯巴达踢** :  这个机制是个大问题，也教你如何应对最后的boss。这个boss会踢坦克，然后朝着他的脚踢出方向放置地面aoe伤害。所以要确保将boss的脚朝离开小队的方向。同时也要注意其他的aoe技能。这个问题是虽然它可以被格挡，但是它仍然会把你击退，从而使你暴露于下一次攻击。 


你有两个选择。一是格挡它并确保你准备好下一步机制，或者你可以闪避它。但请确保你试图保持某种程度的控制，不要在DPS尝试攻击它时移动太多，否则你将需要更长时间！其中， "DPS"指的是游戏角色中的"伤害输出者"。

* **闪电** :  这个BOSS会在地面上生成小型和大型的闪电AOE，情况可能很快混乱，请确保无论职责如何都要避免它们。不要惊慌，只需要不站在它们里面即可。需要注意的是，本句中的BOSS尚未被命名，因此不涉及到任何专有名词的翻译。

* **冲锋** :  在战斗期间，首领会向坦克发起冲锋（因此应该面对着墙），这可以被格挡或闪避，但如果你失败了，你将受到巨大的伤害。DPS和治疗人员会死亡，所以不要被抓住。注意躲开冲锋。其中，坦克应该面对一堵墙以防止被撞到。

* **跳** :  这是许多基础游戏Boss的老派机制，但您将在这里再次看到它。简单的规则。如果您靠近Boss，他将不会使用此能力。如果您离得太远，他将会跳到您的头上，造成巨大冲击区域效果。如果您躲避它，您将活着。如果他击中您，您将会死亡。要小心，观察您的距离。 

* **小BOSS** :  当BOSS的血量降至80%时，它会召唤弓箭手。她很简单，使用轻攻击，会在房间里瞬移，并且有一个危险的锥形攻击，需要避开。

把BOSS叠在她头上然后击杀她，她会在短暂时间内无法行动，然后再返回战斗。

在血量降至50%时，近战迷你boss会出现。他会瞬间传送到远处并施放技能，如果你没有打断他，他会造成高伤害并有能力激怒房间内的敌人。其中的专有名词包括Melee mini boss（近战迷你boss）、interrupt（打断）、enrage（激怒）。其他人物名词则有骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞（Prior Thierric Sarazen）和狡猾的洛格兰（Rogerain the Sly）等等。

攻略：关键在于打断他，但必须作为一个团队移动，不要让首领追击远程玩家。注意不要让首领使用横劈技能，可用典狱长牢牢控制他，而攻击暗影摇篮中的其他敌人。还要小心狡猾的洛格兰和骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞的攻击，不要让他们接近你，可优先击杀他们。在伊胡迪尔的领域里用群体控制技能对付山羊，加强队伍的保护和治疗能力。

把首领顶在他身上，尽可能地杀死他，他会在一段时间后坐下来，然后再回到战斗中。

然而，当BOSS的血量降至30%时，将重新生成这两个小怪物，你可以选择再次击杀它们或者集中攻击BOSS，取决于你的选择！

通常情况下，先消灭小怪再击败首领更容易，但这取决于你的队伍和小怪的控制。如果坦克无法吸引所有三个小怪的仇恨，情况可能会变得棘手。

* **困难模式** :  在困难模式下，所有机制都相同，但是会有几个扭曲的地方。

首先，这个首领拥有更多的生命值，这在困难模式下非常普遍。

其次，弓箭手会在BOSS还活着的时候为其保持盾牌，因此击杀她非常重要。在盾牌有效期间BOSS受到的伤害明显降低。

在执行阶段（大约30%左右），两个小怪物回到房间里时，它们不可被击杀，它们的回复速度超过你所有的攻击速度。因此，坦克必须掌控它们。注：Execute是该游戏中的技能名称，指的是处决技能，可以造成致命伤害。

在Walking Flame DLC最初的PTS循环期间，这些可以像普通资深玩家模式一样在困难模式下被击败。然而，在游戏发布后，他们进行了更改，现在是故意设计成更加困难的执行模式。

保持嘲讽，必要时打断技能施法，然后继续做你正在做的事情！从这里起，没有任何变化！





### 痛苦影暮

* **重击** :  BOSS会向坦克进行重击，这很简单，格挡即可。其中"坦克"指游戏中的角色类型，不是指"储油罐车"等外部事物。

* **机关枪** :  Boss会向一个随机玩家不停地发射能量球，和皇城监狱的领主典狱长完全一样。作为坦克，你要做的只是站在球和目标之间挡住，然后格挡即可。目标应该站在原地不动。注意，这里的Lord Warden被译作了“典狱长”。

* **陨石** :  和王庭骑士长一样，会有陨石从天空中落下。但是有一个小变化，每个玩家都会有一个陨石掉落...你可以格挡或闪避，但由于这种技能的特殊性质，你在战斗中绝对不能集中在一起。 




### 骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞


最终BOSS有很多震慑机制，但如果你一直注意到所有细节，他并不是那么难对付。主要还是需要注意脚下的位置和目标优先级。在战斗中要注意瞄准对手。

这个BOSS并不是你的主要优先事项。这里完全没有DPS检验。只需要确保先击杀小兵。

坦克应该稳住BOSS，最好尽可能在房间中央，这样做会在后面节省一些麻烦，但这是一场非常移动的战斗，所以即使有时他在其他地方也不会影响，只要他保持静止。注：Boss指的是游戏中的一个强大敌人。

不要像没头苍蝇一样乱跑，否则你会死！

* **斯巴达踢** :  和上一个你打过的最后一个boss一样，他会用一个地面范围攻击技能踢飞坦克。这个技能是可以格挡或闪避的。闪避的风险是你会开始乱跑。格挡的风险是在格挡时他仍会顶你一下，让你暴露于下一次攻击之中。用哪种方法都可以，但要准备好他的下一次打击，它非常快！

* **重击横劈** :  相当直观，通常在踢击后立即进行，他会挥动他的武器进行极为宽广的正面横劈攻击。在这些时候，他身上会有一个暗影版本，特别是在困难模式下，所以这是一种“双重打击”。作为坦克一定要格挡，而作为DPS和/或治疗师一定要保持在他的后面。作为坦克格挡是没问题的，但如果是其他角色被击中就得凉了！

* **地刺** :  首领会把剑插入地面进行引导。在此期间，每个玩家脚下会出现小的范围攻击，共4次。每个范围攻击都会有地刺从地面上冒出来给你造成巨大的伤害。这个机制的技巧在于要做一个小小的圆圈移动来放置地刺，直到它们全部消失，然后继续战斗。每个玩家都有自己的范围攻击，所以不要重叠。

* **传送尖刺** :  首领会传送到房间另一侧，一个玩家的脚底下会有一个小标记。这个玩家被标记为死亡。你必须打断首领。如果你没有及时打断它，被标记的玩家将被从地下刺穿（就像暗影摇篮中的最后BOSS威利德雷斯），一击致命。你不会幸存下来，它会给你造成约300-400k的伤害。不要懒惰，打断首领！

* **ADDS** :  这是非常重要的！在战斗期间，房间的两侧会刷新出多个怪物。这些是应该被快速清除的小恶魔，但是你还会发现有一些相当庞大的纳德人在向团队释放各种恶意。这些怪物必须是你的首要目标，他们必须被嘲讽，必须被打断，最重要的是必须将它们消灭。如果你看到的每个怪物都不消灭，你将被压垮。怪兽会不断地堆叠，会让你忙不过来。这些怪物的刷新间隔相当长，所以一旦它们被消灭，你通常需要花费相当长的时间与Boss进行对抗。

消灭小怪，然后再攻击首领，不要独自行动而死亡！

*  **这不是DPS竞赛，你需要击杀小怪，BOSS可以拖延多长时间都可以。**

* **治疗之环** :  Boss 会在战斗中施放一个巨大的治疗之环，它会治疗他自己并对你造成伤害，请不要站在其中，也不要让 BOSS 站在里面。注意避开。 


* **昏迷墙** :  在战斗进行到中途时，首领将开始生成一系列AOE球形墙体，从任意方向滑过地面。这些墙体中有间隙，因此要留意脚下并寻找这些间隙。如果被墙体困住，你将受到严重伤害，并被昏迷，此时将容易遭受其他攻击。

* **这种情况通常以3** : 4波发生，然后会停止约一分钟，然后再次发生。一旦它们投入战斗，你必须不断应对这种堆叠机制。

* **剑之风暴** :  当你的血量降低且以上机制都处理完毕后，Boss会在房间内释放多个大型的红色缓慢移动的旋风。它们比看起来容易控制。不要站在它们里面，这很简单。不要惊慌，它们很容易看到，留意自己的脚下，直到这些旋风消失。 

* **困难模式** :  这场战斗几乎相同，但是他的生命值更高。 



坚持相同的基本策略，在战斗中不断注意脚下的位置并优先攻击小怪。注意首先清理掉小怪。

然而需要进行两个小调整。现在墙壁机制占据整面墙。在普通难度下有几个需要躲避的范围伤害，但在这里你需要避开整个攻击范围。注意脚下。另外，如果你想找到“暗影摇篮”的“恩”、“莱姆”、“里”三位BOSS，需要通过击败“典狱长”和“伊胡迪尔”这两个BOSS，并解决谜题，最终击败“狡猾的洛格兰”和“骑士长谢里克·沙拉赞”。还需要注意避开“横劈”攻击，和闪避“山羊”召唤出的羊群。好运！

传送机制。这非常危险……要用凌厉冲击打断远程攻击，祝你好运，它不会起作用。当他传送时，他现在有一个盾牌，所以是的，这意味着你必须尽可能快地跑向他，进入盾牌内部，在他的面前打断他！

除此之外，请记住要谨慎对付暗影和其他敌人，他们非常难以碰撞。同时，山羊的存在会带给你额外的挑战。祝你好运！

记住，这个游戏看起来比实际上混乱得多，大部分会杀死你的东西实际上就在你身上。

尽可能让首领保持静止，注意你的脚下，保持中断并始终先击杀小怪。没有DPS检测，所以不用着急。建议您可以这样翻译游戏攻略。

> 
> ** WRAITH OF CROWS (SECRET BOSS) **
> 
> As shown in the video this secret boss is pretty straight forward. You have two waves of adds.
> 
> The first wave is 3 adds and the next one is 5-6 adds.
> 
> The tank should be sure to hold them all still and together with them turned away from the group. Once they are killed you will have to fight the boss.
> 
> **Crow Storm** - The boss will pick ONE random player and cast a crow storm aoe at them, if you stand in this you will die, so you will need to kite (move around avoiding it) away from the group until it has gone.
> 
> **Dark Bolts** - The boss will cast almost dark magic like abilities under each player which will quickly POP and do damage under them. Avoid these by moving or simply block
> 
> 
> 
> ROGERAIN THE SLY
> 
> 
> ** ROGERAIN THE SLY **
> 
> This boss looks a lot more chaotic than it is but it is up to you how difficult you make it. If you follow basic mechanics it will be a breeze, if not you may get overwhelmed. The trick to this boss is to rid the room of ANY adds. Do that and you will make this 10x easier on yourselves.
> 
> The tank should position the boss in the middle of the room or in a static spot as and when possible and simply hold him still. There will be mechanics where moving is required but you should be able to keep him in the same local area for the most part.
> 
> **BIG BOOM!** - Very simple this one, the boss will cast a HUGE aoe under his feet. Simply DON'T stand in it. Also it will emit up to 8x individual aoes from inside of it and they will fan out across the floor at the group. All you have to do is move your feet left or right to avoid them. The amount of stuns and damage going on from these mechanics can be quite problematic so always be aware of this ongoing attack.
> 
> **Lightning Winds** - ?The boss will cast small winds of lightning in front of him, block these or avoid them, they don't hit hard but safer to take less damage in the fight than MORE!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - Very simple, if the boss heavy attacks the tank, block it. If the tank has lost aggro for whatever reason and it aims at a dps/healer, be sure to dodge it or die!
> 
> **Frogs!** - During the fight the boss will spawn frogs! These are simple adds with small aoe attacks and direct attacks. These should be killed as soon as possible to lessen the chaotic style of the fight and keep things simple. They do not have a lot of health and CAN be chained and/or stunned so be sure to make these a priority when they are around. Remember too many stacking mechanics is what causes problems, delete them!
> 
> **Poison splats!** - The boss will make multiple small and LARGE poison splat time blobs fly around the room and land in random locations and/or on players. If they are on the floor of course don't stand in them. If they are aimed at a player, the aoe will spread then pop. Much like in many other dungeons for ice comet like effects, these will need to be blocked in a safe open space. Do NOT stack them.
> 
> **Daedric Portals** - These Portals will be spawned by the boss, usually in the corners of the room so keep your eyes open. When they spawn you need to kill them. The longer they are up the more enemies will come out of them.
> 
> generally they spawn Flesh Atronachs, Daedra Spiders and Watchers. These MUST be killed but the Portal takes the priority first to stop them coming through. Adds are always a primary target in this dungeon so while you can manipulate their position to fight the boss at the same time, you should still focus all adds OVER the boss.
> 
> Order of priority is simple.
> 
> 1) Portals
> 
> 2) ANY adds
> 
> 3) Boss.
> 
> It doesn't matter how long it takes, just be sure you do this or you will end up overwhelmed. If you also do not get rid of the portal in due time, another will spawn and so on. Making it really tricky.
> 
> **YOU ARE THE GOAT!** - That's right!! The boss turns you into a GOAT! One player at random (usually not the tank unless it drops the taunt) will be turned into a goat and the room will be filled with Sweetrolls. As the goat all you have to do is run around and collect these to help the group. You help them build ultimate, increase damage, increase healing, and heal for each one you pick up.
> 
> Once the timer is up you return back to your original form.
> 
> One more major bonus is that if you charge the portal as a goat, you will do MUCH more damage to it and save it from causing you problems in the fight.
> 
> **Hardmode** - This is a basic hardmode. The fight is exactly the same but he has a LOT more health and hits a little harder. Give it a go, you can do it !
> 
> 
> 
> SPIDER DAEDRA
> 
> 
> ** SPIDER DAEDRA (SECRET BOSS) **
> 
> As shown in the video this secret boss is pretty straight forward. You have two waves of adds.
> 
> The first wave is 3 adds and the next one is 5-6 adds.
> 
> The tank should be sure to hold them all still and together with themturned away from the group. Once they are killed you will have to fight the boss.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This mechanic pretty self explanatory, block it!
> 
> **Spit** - The boss pick one player at random to spit at, exactly the same as the last boss in Spindleclutch I. So long as you stay spread out you can see who she is targeting. All you need to do is dodge roll to avoid it.
> 
> **Lightning** - Two players at a time will be targeted with a lightning strike. You have two options here, dodge it or block it. The choice is yours.
> 
> 
> 
> ELIAM MERICK
> 
> 
> ** ELIAM MERICK, LIRAMINDEL, IHUDIR **
> 
> This boss VERY mobile! The tank should hold the boss as still as possible at all times while trying to have him aimed away from the group, preferably towards a wall. The boss WILL need to move around alot so be sure to maintain a taunt at ALL times and keep up your resources else it will get tricky.
> 
> **Heavy** - Basic hits for the tank to deal with, be sure to block.
> 
> **Sparta kick** - This mechanic is a BIG problem and teaches you about the last boss too. The boss will KICK the tank and also emit some ground based aoe in the direction he kicks. So be sure to have this turned away from the group.
> 
> The problem with this is while it can be BLOCKED it will STILL knock you back anyway making you open to the next attack.
> 
> You have two options. Block it and be SURE you are ready for the next mechanic, OR you can dodge roll it. However be sure that you try to maintain some sort of control and don't move around too much while the dps are trying to hit him because it will take you a LOT longer!
> 
> **Lightning!** - The boss will spawn small and large lightning aoes on the ground, this can get quite hectic so be sure to avoid them at all costs regardless of role. Don't panic, just don't stand in them.
> 
> **Charge!** - During the fight the boss will charge at the tank (hence why you should face towards a wall), This can be blocked or dodged but if you fail you will be run down and take HUGE damage. DPS and Healers will die so do not get caught.
> 
> **JUMP!** - This is an old school mechanic for many of the base game bosses, but you get to see it all over again here. Simple rule. If you stay close to the boss, he won't ever use this ability. If you are too far away he will jump on your head with a MASSIVE impact aoe. If you dodge it you will live. If he hits you, you will die. Be careful, watch your distance.
> 
> **Mini Bosses** - At 80% The boss will spawn the Archer add. This is simple, she has light attacks, teleports around the room and has a nasty cone attack which you should avoid.
> 
> Stack the boss ON her head and kill her, and she will be incapacitated for a short while before she returns to the fight.
> 
> At 50% the Melee mini boss will come in. He will teleport to long distances and channel, if you don't interrupt him he will do high damage and has the ability to enrage the enemies in the room.
> 
> The trick to this is to interrupt him but move as a group to NOT allow the boss to do his JUMP chasing down long ranged players.
> 
> Stack the boss on him and kill him as and when you can and he will sit down for a while before coming back to the fight.
> 
> At 30% however the boss will respawn BOTH of the adds and you will have to kill them again or just focus the boss. The choice is yours!
> 
> it's easier to kill them first then finish the boss but it depends on your group and control of the adds. If the tank cannot maintain taunts on all 3, it can get tricky.
> 
> **HARDMODE!** - On hard mode ALL of the mechanics are the same BUT there are a couple of twists.
> 
> Firstly the boss has a LOT more health, which is pretty standard for Hard modes.
> 
> Secondly the Archer will actually keep a shield around the boss while she is alive, hence why it is important to kill her. The boss will take MUCH less damage while the shield is active.
> 
> Also at Execute (around 30% or so) When the two adds come back into the room, they CANNOT be killed, they will out heal everything you do. So the tank MUST manage them.
> 
> During the original PTS cycle of the Walking Flame DLC these could be killed on hard mode much like they can on regular veteran. However they changed it upon release and NOW the execute is deliberately more difficult.
> 
> Maintain taunts, interrupt when necessary and keep doing what you are doing! nothing changes from here!
> 
> 
> 
> GRIEVOUS TWILIGHT
> 
> 
> ** GRIEVOUS TWILIGHT **
> 
> As shown in the video this secret boss is pretty straight forward. You have two waves of adds.
> 
> The first wave is 3 adds and the next one is 5-6 adds.
> 
> The tank should be sure to hold them all still and together with them turned away from the group. Once they are killed you will have to fight the boss.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss will Heavy attack the tank, this is simple, Block it.
> 
> **Machine Gun** - The boss cast a constant wave of energy balls at a random player, exactly the same as Lord Warden from Imperial City Prison. All you have to do as a tank is physically get in the WAY of it and block. The target should stand still.
> 
> **Meteors** - Also like lord warden, meteors will fly from the sky. This has a slight twist though, instead of ONE which all should avoid, he casts one per PLAYER...Block it or dodge it but of course due to the nature of this skill, you should NEVER stack up in this fight.
> 
> 
> 
> PRIOR THIERRIC SARAZEN
> 
> 
> ** PRIOR THIERRIC SARAZEN **
> 
> The Final boss, has LOTS of staggering mechanics but if you have paid full attention to everything so far, he is NOT that bad at all. It's mostly foot work and prioritizing targets.
> 
> The BOSS is NOT your main priority. There is NO dps check at all. Just be sure to kill the ADDS first.
> 
> The tank should hold the boss STILL, preferably mostly in the middle of the room if possible, doing so will save you complications later on, but it is a very mobile fight so it's not the end of the world if he is in other places sometimes, so long as he is standing still.
> 
> DO NOT run around like a headless chicken, you WILL die!
> 
> **Sparta Kick** - Exactly like the last boss, you fought, he will kick the tank with a ground based aoe following it. This is blockable or dodgeble. The risk to dodging is that you start running around too much. The risk to blocking is that while blocking he will STILL nudge you back leaving you open to the next attack. Do whatever works better for you but be READY for his next hit, it IS fast!
> 
> **Heavy Attack/Cleave** - Pretty straight forward, usually straight after the Sparta Kick, he will hit with a really wide frontal cleave swinging his weapon. He does have a shadow version of himself during these times especially on hardmode so it is kind of a double hitter. be sure as the tank to block this and as DPS and/or healers be sure to stay BEHIND him. Blocking it as the tank is fine, getting hit as anything else is dead mode!
> 
> **Ground Spikes** - The boss will stab his sword into the ground channeling. During this time each player will have a small aoe pop under their feet 4 times. Each one contains a spike that will come up from the ground and hit you for huge damage. The trick to this is to move in a tiny circle to place them on the ground until they have all gone and then resume the fight. Each player has their own so do NOT over lap. It's very simple to the fanning out type mechanic from the lighting in Asylum Sanctorium.
> 
> **Teleport Spike!** - The Boss will teleport across the other side of the room, and one player will have a small marker under their feet. This player is marked to die. You MUST interrupt the boss. If you do not do it in time, the marked player will be stabbed from under the ground with a spike (like cradle of shadows last boss velidreth) and be killed with a one shot. No you will not survive it, it will hit you for about 300-400k. Don't be lazy, interrupt the boss!
> 
> **ADDS** - This is essential! During the fight MULTIPLE adds will spawn in the room from the sides. Small daedra that should be dispatched quickly, but also you will have some rather large Nords channeling all manner of nastiness at the group. These MUST be your primary focus, they must be taunted, they must be interrupted and above all they MUST be killed. If you don't kill every add you see you will get overwhelmed. The adds will continuously stack and you will have too much to deal with. The add spawns are quite far apart so once they are dead you generally have a 'you vs the boss' moment for quite a long period of time.
> 
> Kill the adds, THEN the boss, don't go yoloing and die!
> 
> Even in the video we could have finished the boss, but sometimes it is not worth it. There is NO dps race, kill the adds, the boss can take as long as you like.
> 
> **Healing circles** - The boss will cast BIG healing circles in the fight, these will heal him and damage you, don't stand in them and don't let HIM stand in them.
> 
> **Stun Walls** - Around mid way into the fight the boss will start to spawn walls of AOE ball that slide across the floor from a random direction. There are GAPS in these so watch your feet and look for the gap. If you get caught you will take high damage, be stunned and then open to other attacks.
> 
> NOTE: This is why we tank the boss in the middle as often as possible, that way you can see the walls much earlier. If you hold him on the corner or the wall then they could spawn on your face!
> 
> These usually happen in waves of 3-4 and then they will stop for around a minute and then happen again. Once they are introduced to the fight it is a stacking mechanic you must now constantly deal with.
> 
> **Blade Tempest** - At low health now you have all of the above mechanics dealt with , he will cast multiple big red SLOW moving whirlwinds in the room. These are easier to manage than they look. Don't stand in them. it really is as simple as that. Don't panic, they are easy to see, watch your feet until they are gone.

> Remember, it LOOKS more chaotic than it is and most of the stuff that will kill you, is literally on you.
