> Crypt of Hearts I




### 大法师

> The Mage Master


** ?法师大师 **

这个首领非常简单。他身边有4个法师类型的敌人，必须从一开始就由坦克控制，以防止他们四处乱跑。DPS和治疗也需要注意打断技能，不要在房间里乱跑，放松心情，阻止他们做出任何愚蠢的行为。坦克应该在整个战斗中尽可能保持一切静止，并锁定任何试图逃跑的增援。

* **升天击** :  这是一种非常简单的肉搏攻击，以升天击的形式展现，并必须被格挡。任何角色都可以格挡，但只会攻击当前被威胁（主要是坦克，除非威胁降低了）的角色。如果未被格挡，伤害非常大，但如果被格挡，伤害不算太大。不要错过格挡，否则你会被击倒。

“元素戒指”——这是一个在地面上形成的甜甜圈形状的区域攻击，通常会让坦克站在中间。在里面和外面都是安全区域，但是如果碰到边缘，你会受到相当大的伤害，所以避免在里面长时间站着。

* **攻略翻译如下

Negate** :  通常在前一个效果之后，他会在同一个区域上放置一个阻止的泡泡。因此，这是一个权衡点。如果你是DPS或治疗者，确保你不在里面，但是作为坦克，如果你碰到边缘，你就会受到伤害，在中间是安全的，但现在你在一个泡泡里，这意味着你有两个选择……承受伤害并离开泡泡，或者留在里面，保持嘲讽和格挡，并依赖你的治疗者。你现在需要依赖治疗师，因为在泡泡里，你不能使用任何魔法技能，直到它消失。耐力技能、重击和格挡可以使用，但你的魔法技能不能使用。按照你的舒适程度来进行游戏。





### 大师斯聂尔

> Archmaster Siniel


**大师斯聂尔**

这个BOSS很简单，他基本上从不移动，坐在中间施放恶意法术，召唤小怪，并在自己身上抛出伤害护盾。这是一场非常直接的战斗。挑衅它，站在原地，团队应该找到自己的空间并保持在其中。

* **攻略翻译
恐惧** :  每隔一段时间，首领将施放一个范围恐惧，持续2秒。这是一个非常简单的机制，不是特别危险，只是令人恼火。解除控制并回到原位。

* **地面范围攻击** :  在整场战斗中，他会在地面上施放一个糟糕的范围攻击技能，请远离它，这个范围攻击有定身效果并且会造成一些糟糕的伤害。抗性低的玩家会非常快地死在这个攻击下！

* **召唤僵尸** :  在战斗中，首领会召唤许多僵尸来帮助他。它们非常容易被群攻击杀死，但如果你的团队在这方面缺乏，不要惊慌。简单地继续做你正在做的事情，让坦克控制它们，它们很快就会死亡。不要在房间里乱跑，这会让坦克的工作非常困难，并使敌人离开地面上的伤害区域。

* **伤害护盾** :  当首领血量较低时，他会在自己的血条上施加一个伤害护盾。你需要击破伤害护盾的血量才能继续攻击他的血条。你无法对伤害护盾造成暴击，所以这可能需要花费一些时间，但机制保持不变。只要集中精力，你就能轻松应对，他最终会死亡。





### 死神的利维坦

> Death's Leviathan


**死亡利维坦**

这个BOSS非常有趣，但如果玩家不注意，那么战斗可能会变得非常混乱。这场战斗全凭坦克控制BOSS。如果坦克失去对BOSS的控制，那将是一片混乱，很难打掉BOSS，更别提在BOSS的暴怒机制下幸存。这可能非常简单或非常困难。这取决于你！

* **冲锋** :  这里需要你的坦克人员将Boss定位在一个位置上，以便它可以处于攻击的范围内而不会在房间里乱跑。当它发起冲锋时，它会笔直地朝着面部的方向奔跑。因此，你需要让坦克人员将Boss背靠墙角，这样它就会直着朝着墙冲过去。每次Boss完成冲锋后，移动到附近的另一个角落，重复这个过程。

* **爆发** :  在冲锋技能之后，他会踩踏地面并创建一个快速增长的大型爆发区域。这可以被格挡或闪避，并且非常容易发现。在这个阶段，伤害不算太糟糕，但你仍然需要避免。对于dps，在爆发区域消失时，只需闪避出去，然后再回来攻击即可。

* **攻略翻译
狂怒** :  当Boss生命值低于一定程度时，他将用火焰强化自己！他的冲锋技能现在会释放出一个巨大的火焰轨迹，不要站在上面。此外，他的爆发技能现在还带有额外的火焰伤害。你仍然可以格挡和躲闪最初的伤害，但是第二次伤害会打倒你，无论如何都会中招。所以一定要尽力避免或格挡这场技能，否则会被击败。





### 尤尔卡·骨手

> Uulkar bonehand


**尤尔卡·骨手**

这个BOSS看起来比实际的恐怖得多。首先，他不能失去平衡，因此免疫此类攻击，这意味着战斗会比大多数BOSS持续时间更长，对于经验不足的团队而言，维持能力可能是一个问题，但如果你掌握了节奏，你就会没事的。关键是你的小队位置的摆放。

* **地面范围效果（Ground aoe）** :  地面上的一个小圆圈能够持续造成伤害并略微减速，简单避开即可，这些效果会在整个战斗中定期出现。

* **巫妖水晶** : 每隔几秒钟，首领会生成两个圆圈的巫妖水晶，外面有5个，中间有3个。它们会扩散并爆炸。这是最值得注意的机制，但也是最容易避免的。就像视频演示一样，保持靠近并保持在它们之间的空隙中。这样做意味着你永远不会受到它们的伤害。只需注意你的脚步即可！

如果你被巫妖水晶击中，你会受到很大的伤害，所以要小心。





### 狂战士多加斯

> Dogas The Berserker


** 狂战士多加斯 **

这个首领非常小，生命值不到100万。高DPS的团队会很快击败他，但我们来这里是为了了解机制，所以当然要解释该怎么做。你的坦克必须在这个boss身上保持警惕，因为有很多敌人需要管理。抓住所有的小怪（固定它们或嘲讽它们），并对boss使用嘲讽技能。让boss保持在中央位置，这样团队就可以尽可能快地杀死所有AOE范围内的敌人，并将单体伤害集中在boss身上。

* **升天击** :  首领会不时对坦克（或其它掌握敌人仇恨的角色）使用升天击，这招会使人昏倒并造成大量伤害，所以一定要格挡它！而且有时首领会从潜行中发动升天击，所以一定要注意看见升天击的火花特效，如果他突然消失了，提前格挡。

* **攻略
灵魂缚扰** :  这个技能与夜刃能力非常相似，首领会偶尔晕眩小队，然后从每个小队成员那里吸取生命4-5秒。晕眩可以打破并可以格挡初始伤害。





### 伊拉姆布里斯-扎文

> Ilambris-Zaven


**伊拉姆布里斯双子：扎文和阿索尔**

Crypt of Hearts I的最终BOSS实际上是两个首领。杀死其中一个会激怒另一个，所以如果你有很高的伤害输出，你可以同时把它们两个杀死，但是本攻略会重点讲解机制，因此我会解释我个人如何处理这个BOSS，同时本攻略中也有相应的视频演示。让坦克把拿着双手武器的蓝色BOSS从中心圆圈里面拖出去，保持对红色法师BOSS的远程嘲讽。这样除了AOE伤害之外，所有的伤害都会集中在坦克身上，这样战斗就会更加简洁明了。DPS应该集中火力攻击法师BOSS，然后在它死亡后，把蓝色BOSS置于中心并把它留在那里。在这场战斗中，DPS和治疗需要避开各种机制，但是不要在房间里乱奔！

Athor (蓝色Boss)

* **升天击** :  升天击威力极大，能造成很高的伤害，而且打击效果很强力。但是必须格挡，第一时间出现后进行格挡。升天击在视觉效果尚未发生前，就已撞击目标，因此要随时保持警惕，一旦看到就立即格挡。通常坦克应该抵挡升天击，但是如果发生了意外情况，输出职业可以通过格挡来挺过去。否则，他们将会被秒杀。在战斗过程中，在每次升天击之间，会对坦克施放闪电伤害，但是伤害微乎其微，可以无视。

* **攻略翻译如下
气泡** :  在战斗中，Athor 会偶尔在地面上施放小型的闪电区域，并用一个小圆顶覆盖它们。不要站在它们里面，它们会给你造成可怕的闪电伤害。不需要惊慌，它们不会移动。只需远离它们即可。

* **狂怒** :  如果你击败了另一个兄弟，两个boss都会有狂怒机制，但为了让战斗更容易，总是先杀扎文（红色法师）。不然房间会充满火焰，难以应对。当扎文死亡后，阿索尔会进入狂怒状态。坦克应该把boss带到扎文死亡的中心位置，dps和治疗应该找到自己的位置，并逐渐消耗boss的生命值。机制和之前一样，坦克可以静止不动并格挡重击，但现在会间歇性地召唤闪电雨。不要惊慌！在房间里乱跑会让你撞上正在来袭的闪电，保持当前动作，放松、输出伤害，如果有任何雷电降落在你附近，简单地移开一点就行了。小心地踩踏，避免头脑发热。

Zaven（红色BOSS）

* **攻略翻译
火焰爆炸** :  Zaven 会定期在房间内施放一次巨大的AOE技能，它会迅速蔓延并爆炸。如果你在其中，即使防御也会被击倒。你需要尽快离开此范围，等到技能效果结束后再回到原来的位置。至于坦克，要在范围外待着，如果你不小心被震飞到某个电球范围内并被 Athor 攻击前无法爬起来，你就会死亡。

* **火焰痕迹** : 偶尔扎文会举起手指，瞄准持有仇恨的人。通常是坦克，但不总是。他会在地面上施放一条直线状的火焰。如果他的目标是你，只需移动到一侧让其通过。如果这个攻击击中了DPS或治疗职业，基本上就是秒杀。

* **「轮子」** :  游戏中多个Boss版本都有这一个特效，但我总是称之为「轮子」。如果你能想象一下从鸟瞰视角下看车轮的样子……像一个圆上的扇形，就是我最能描述这个效果的方法了。火焰的扇形将从Boss的脚部喷发而出。它们造成的伤害很低，可以避免，不会成为太大的问题。所以只要保持警惕，并避免它们或者准备好治疗就好了。

> 
> This boss is very simple. He has 4 mage type enemies with him which must be controlled by the tank from the very beginning so they don't run around. The dps and healer also need to pay attention to interupts so don't run around the room, relax and stop them from doing anything stupid. The tank should hold everything as still as possible through out the fight and chain in any adds that try to run away.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is a pretty simple melee attack in the form of an uppercut and must be blocked. Any role can block this but it will only hit whoever is agroed (mainly the tank unless the taunt has droped) It does a lot of damage if NOT blocked, but if you do block it, it doesn't hit too hard. Don't miss the block though else you will get knocked over.
> 
> **Elemental Ring** - This is donut shaped aoe on the floor usually making the tank sit in the middle. Inside of it and outside of it is the safe area but if you tough the edges you will take a fair amount of damage, so avoid standing in this for long periods of time.
> 
> **Negate** - usually after the previous effect he will drop a negate bubble on top of the same aoe. So this is the trade off point. if you are dps or healer make sure you are out of it, but as the tank, if you tough the edges, you take damage, in the middle is safe but NOW you are in a bubble which means you have two choices...take damage and leave the bubble, OR stay inside, hold a taunt and block and rely on your healer. The reason you will now be relying on your healer is because INSIDE the bubble you CANNOT use any magicka abilities until it has gone. Stamina abilities, heavy attacks and blocks work, but you magic abilities will not. PLay it however you are comfortable.

> ?This boss is very simple, he basically never moves and sits in the middle casting nastiness, spawning adds, and throwing damage shields on himself. about as straight forward as a fight can get. Taunt it, stand still, and the group should find their own space and stay in it.
> 
> **Fear** - Every so often the boss with cast an aoe fear for 2 seconds. This is a very simple mechanics, it isnt particularly dangerous, just annoying. Break free and get back to where you were.
> 
> **Ground aoe** - Throughout the fight he will cast a nasty aoe on the ground, stay OUT of this, it has immobilizing effects and does some nasty damage. Low resist players will die to this very fast!
> 
> **Summon Zombies** - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn many zombies to help him. They are VERY low health and should die to aoe damage however if your group is lacking in that area do NOT panic. Simple keep doing what you are doing, let the tank control them and they will die in no time. Do NOT run around the room, it makes the tanks job very difficult and just moves enemies out of the damage on the floor.
> 
> **Damage shield** - At low health the boss will put a damage shield on his health bar. You simple have to kill the health of the damage shield before you can continue to hit his health bar. You cannot crit a damage shield so this may take a little time but the mechanics stay the same. Just focus and you will be fine, inevitably he will die.

> This boss is so much fun but can get incredibly chaotic if people do not pay attention. This fight is all about the tank controlling the boss. If the tank looses control of this boss it is all out mayhem and very hard to get damage on the boss let alone survive his enrage mechanics. This can be really simple or really difficult. It's up to you!
> 
> **Charge** - This is where your tank has to position the boss so that he can stay in the damage and not run around the room. When he charges he will go in a straight line aiming in the direction he is FACING at the time. So get your tank to position their back into a corner so that he runs straight at the wall. Every time he has finished charging move to another corner close by and repeat the process.
> 
> **Burst** - After the charge ability he will stamp the ground and creat a fast growing large BURTS aoe. This can be blocked or dodge rolled and is very easy to spot. The damage is not so bad at this stage but you need to avoid it none the less. for dps, simply dodge roll out and then get back in when it is gone.
> 
> **Enraged** - At low health the boss will buff himself with FIRE! His charge ability now emits a massive fire trail wherever he ran from and to, so do NOT stand in this. Also his burst ability now has an added fire damage burst to it. You can still block and dodge the initial damage BUT the second tick of damage will still hit you and you will be knocked over regardless. So be sure to avoid/block this as best you can or it will wipe you out.

> This boss is pretty looks a lot scarier than it actually is. Firstly he cannot go off balance so he is immune to that, meaning the fight will last a little bit longer than most and sustain can be an issue for lesser experienced groups BUT if you pace it you will be just fine. The key is the positioning of your group.
> 
> **Ground aoe** - A small circle on the floor which does damage overtime and a slight snare, simply avoid these, they happen periodically through out the fight.
> 
> **Lich Crystals** - Every few seconds, the boss will spawn 2 circles of lich crystals. 5 on the outside and 3 in the middle. They grow in aoe and then explode. This is the most dramatic mechanic but the easiest to avoid. As demonstrated in the video, stay close and just stay in the gaps between them. doing this means you will never take any damage from them. Simply watch your feet!
> 
> If you get hit by the lich crystals you will take a lot of damage so be careful.

> This boss is very small and has under 1million health. A high dps group will make mince meat of this guy but we are here to learn about mechanics so of course i shall explain what to do. Your tank has to be on his/her toes on this one since there are a lot of enemies to manage. Grab all the adds(pin them or taunt them) and hold a taunt on the boss. Keep the boss central so the group can kill everything in aoe as fast as possible while focusing single target stuff on the boss.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - very so often the boss will aim a heavy attack at the tank(or whoever has agro) this has a nasty knock down and a lot of damage so make sure you block it! Also this can sometimes be done from stealth so be sure to keep your eyes open for the heavy attack sparks effect in thin air if he vanishes and block EARLY.
> 
> **Soul Teather** - Very much like the nightblade ability, the boss will occasionally stun the group and then life steal each member for 4-5 seconds. The stun can be broken free and you can block the initial damage.

> The final boss in Crypt of hearts I is Actually two bosses at once. Killing one will enrage the other so you CAN kill them both together if you have a lot of damage but this is about mechanics so i will explain how i personally would do this as also descripbed and demonstraited in the video. Get the tank to hold The blue boss with the two hander out of the center circle, and keep a ranged taunt on the red mage boss. This way all the damage will go to the tank excluding aoe damage. This will make the fight MUCH cleaner. The dps should focus the mage and then once it is dead , put the blue one in his place and hold him in the middle. The dps and healer will need to move form mechanics in this fight but do NOT sprint around the room!
> 
> **Athor (blue boss)**
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The heavy attack is HUGE, does a lot of damage, a massive knock down and is delayed. This MUST be blocked BUT block the second you see it. It will connect with the target before the visual for the swing actually happens so keep your eyes peeled and block as soon as you see this. This should always be on the tank but if something goes wrong the dps can survive it IF they block. If not, they are dead. Also during the fight and between heavy attacks a lightning dot will be cast on the tank. It does barely any damage.
> 
> **Bubbles** - occasionally during the fight Athor will cast tiny lightning aoes on the ground with a small dome covering them. Do NOT stand in these they hit you with a nasty amount of lightning damage. No need to panic, they dont move. Just stay out of them.
> 
> **Enrage** - Both bosses have enrage mechanics if you kill the opposite brother, but to make things easier on yourself, always kill zaven (red mage) first else the room can get filled with fire and it is hard to manage. When Zaven is dead Athor will enrage. The tank should take the boss to the center when zaven was and your dps and healers should find their own space and just gradually burn him down. The mechanics are the same as before, the tank can stand still and block heavy attacks BUT now occasionally Athor will call down a rain of lightning. DO NOT PANIC! running around the room will make you run into incoming effects, keep doing what you are doing, relax, do your damage and if any land near you, simple move a little bit out of the way of them and you will be fine. Careful foot work, not headless chicken mode!
> 
> **Zaven (red boss)**
> 
> **Flame Burst** - Periodically Zaven wioll cast a MASSIVE aoe in the room, it will spread and explode. If you are in this you will be knocked down even if blocking. You need to get out of this asap and then get back in position once it is gone. As for the tank, stay out side of this, if you are inside of it and you are knocked down, WHILE Athor is winding up a heavy attack and you accidentally get thrown into a lightning bubble too...you are dead.
> 
> **Fire Trail** - Occasionally Zaven will raise his hand aiming at whoever has agro. This should be the tank but not always. He will cast a striaght line of flames across the ground. So if it is aiming at YOU, simply move to one side and let it pass. If this hits a dps or a healer, it is pretty much a one shot.
> 
> **The wheel** - There are several versions of this for multiple bosses in the game but i always refer to it as 'the wheel'. If you can imagine from a birds eye view of a wagon wheel...lots of spokes like the sectioning of a circle, that is how i can best describe this effect. Spokes of flame will fire from the bosses feet. These are low damage, avoidable and not too much of a problem. so just keep your eyes peeled and either avoid them of have a heal to hand.
