### 沃瑞亚的杰作

> VORIA'S MASTERPIECE


攻略翻译如下：
**欧维亚的杰作：秘密BOSS #3**

这个boss只有在你击败了前两个boss之后才能挑战。房间非常大，所以你有很多空间来作战，但这也是一个很好的理由。你将面对很多挑战。

坦克应该集中精力让Boss尽可能地保持在中央，并使用中央拽钩作为枢轴点。始终将Boss背对着团队并且不要放开嘲讽。

* **重型攻击** :  Boss偶尔会向坦克发动攻击。只需格挡这个攻击就可以了。

* **跺脚** :  首领会跺地板，并在地面上放置一个巨大的持续伤害区域，通常在90％和40％左右。不要站在里面。每当他放置一个时，作为坦克，你应该在靠近或重叠但是在安全位置放置下一个准备好转移环绕点的中心。如果你散开得太远，这可能会导致房间被填满。

在这里，你必须寻找一个安全的平台，并且使用抓钩技能避免受到爆炸伤害。一旦爆炸结束，你就可以回到中间区域继续游戏。其中 Blastbones（自爆干骨）和 Ondagore the Mad（疯狂的昂达戈尔）等BOSS在游戏中出现。注意避免被他们的攻击打败。

* **骷髅** :  在踩踏之后，骨架将从AOE区域生成。会有几个小的骨架不是很难对付，可以通过被动AOE来消灭掉，但会出现有一个双手武器的骨架。如果你不杀死他，你会遇到麻烦。重叠的机制会影响你，人们可能会死亡。

这个加成必须尽快被坦克嘲讽！它有一个非常强大的重型攻击，DPS/治疗师无法阻挡它，他们必须在被定位后闪避或死亡。

* **加油** :  在战斗中，首领会猛击地面，造成地面产生范围伤害圈（需要避开），但同时大型史莱姆类型的敌人会生成。在战斗的早期阶段，它们的生命值相对较低而且多数会因为范围伤害而死亡，但随着战斗的进行它们变得越来越大！

有些敌人的生命值能够高达11百万以上！

你不需要试图造成1100万点的伤害来击败这些敌人。如果你使用铁钩穿过目标，它们就会分成两半。重复此过程，直到它们死亡。你也可以通过铁钩杀死它们。

当然，如果你有高伤害和机械意识，你可以堆叠并燃烧boss，但如果按照机制进行操作，这对于拯救生命是十分重要的，因为情况可能会变得有些繁忙。





### 被遗忘者纳博尔

> NABOR THE FORGOTTEN


NABOR THE FORGOTTEN：秘密Boss #1

这个首领比较棘手，但相对简单。这将真正测试拥有抓钩机制（又名“蝙蝠侠”）技能的玩家的能力。坦克必须一直维持控制首领并尽可能地让他保持静止状态。

输出/治疗角色需要注意周围环境。

这个首领永远不会移动，但是团队需要移动，所以要保持警觉。

* **重击** :  这个首领时不时会朝坦克扔出一个攻击。只要用盾牌格挡就可以了，你就没事了。

* **大炸弹** :  这个机制非常简单但需要小心。首领开始引导施法，你所在的平台和其他多个平台将会在上面形成一个扩散的AOE范围。如果你站在其中任何一个平台上当它爆炸时，你将会死亡和/或被抛出边缘。

在这里，你必须寻找一个安全的平台，然后使用抓钩到达安全区，直到爆炸结束为止。一旦爆炸结束，你可以再次回到中间地带。

* **小怪** :  在75%血量以下时，BOSS会在房间周围召唤小怪。这些弓箭手是一个大问题，会选择随机的个体目标瞄准。

如果它们成功了，它们会将玩家推下悬崖并杀死他们。

在他们的聚能瞄准技能期间，你有几个选项可以防止它。

你可以打断目标的行动（近战或远程攻击）。

你可以让坦克把它们拽进战斗，和Boss一起消灭它们。

要安全的选择是让一个输出职业杀小怪。逐个击杀小怪以防止它们对人员施放核弹攻击。

你和你的团队该如何处理它们完全取决于你们，但一定要在它们咏唱时百分之百打断它们，否则游戏会很快结束！在这个阶段，你将会遇到火、闪电和冰的机制。

非困难模式没有以前的Boss机制和小怪。它远远没有那么紧张。这需要练习，祝你好运！





### 嚎叫者哈克格里姆

> HAKGRYM THE HOWLER


**嚎叫者哈克格里姆**

这个Boss相当强力，看起来会令人畏惧，如果坦克不注意的话，可能会造成很大的麻烦。他的基础攻击并不算太糟糕，但他的主要机制可能会造成很大的伤害！当然，坦克应该始终保持嘲讽，并且始终将Boss背对着团队！

* **重击** :  这个Boss会发动一个漫长的重击，造成极高的伤害。如果你是dps/治疗职业，你必须躲开它，否则你将会死亡。但是如果你是坦克职业，你必须格挡它，但是要确保你在满血或高血的状态下。在半血或低血的情况下格挡它尤其是如果你不是一个很厚的坦克，那么你将会瞬间死亡。如果你是一个血量很低的坦克，你可能想要谨慎地时机好了然后闪避开这一招。

* **巫妖水晶** :  这个机制相当简单。首领在整个战斗过程中会在地面上施放双重的巫妖水晶。水晶会逐渐扩散，并在达到最大尺寸时爆炸。只需远离这些水晶并避免被击中即可。如果被击中，DPS /治疗者的生命值至少会减半，但如果他们已经很低或一次被几个击中，他们将死亡。

* **图腾** :  Boss 偶尔会在房间内召唤出一个图腾。一旦你发现它，你必须尽快杀死它。如果不这样做，它会不断释放魔法伤害攻击全队。它存在的时间越长，造成的伤害越大，并有可能导致全灭。一定要在它召唤出来后立即集中攻击。

* **马尔科姆（血肉魔像）** :  这个机制非常简单。当老板的血量下降到大约70％和20％时（取决于DPS，您可以超过这个值），他会传送到房间的一侧并释放出一个血肉魔像！它们的血量相当多，但必须尽快击败它们。它们在地面上有一个巨大的散开AOE涂抹，必须避免。如果您尝试过快地燃烧并忽略这些附加功能，则最终将得到两个。这是不必要的。击败它们并继续执行机制。

* **小怪** :  在战斗中，首领会召唤不死的狼，一定要快速击杀它们，因为它们会给小队带来压力。坦克应该尽量将它们留在首领身边，以避免它们在房间里四处散开。

* **狂暴模式（变形）** :  当BOSS生命值降至0%时，它将化身为一只巨大的狼人！战斗变得有些混乱，所以不要惊慌。上面提到的机制仍然存在，包括巫妖水晶等，但你还需要应对一些其他机制。

* **跺脚** :  首领会在地面上跺脚，造成大面积的范围伤害。你必须避开这个范围，当看到它时，简单地踏出去即可。

* **冲锋** :  Boss 会选择一个方向冲锋，并跑过所有在他路径上的玩家，造成巨大的伤害！你必须避开它。

当他冲锋时，许多不死族的小怪会出现，需要处理。坦克应该尽量叠加它们，而团队应该试着在它们出现时减少AOE伤害，以帮助击倒它们。





### 炉窑守护者

> KEEPER OF THE KILN


** 窑炉守护者 **

这个首领很简单，但如果你认为你可以跳过机制，最好再想一想。这是团队杀手中的团队杀手。

在这场战斗中，最重要的是遵守机制，否则就是死路一条！

地面上有四个平台，头顶上有三个攀爬点。这些非常重要。

坦克角色应该一开始将BOSS拖至四个混凝土方块之一并保持静止。其他成员的操作如下。不要取消嘲讽技能。

* **重击** :  首领有一个相当猛烈的重击。如果你是坦克，应该没有阻挡这个攻击的问题，而且你不会受到太多伤害。但是，如果你是一个DPS或治疗者，你会被一击秒杀，所以如果不知什么原因这个攻击瞄准了你而你不是坦克，一定要躲闪它。

* **小怪** :  房间周围有许多你无法与之互动的立着的雕像。在80%、70%、60%、50%、40%血量时，它们会活过来并参战。

坦克应尽快抓住它们，而不会让首领旋转，并将它们全部堆在一起。小组应尽快集中攻击它们。

注意在攻击首领时不要过度输出伤害，否则房间中会出现过多的小兵，这将会根据你的队伍而难以控制。

如果这些小怪尝试进行重攻击，请确保使用格挡。请注意，如果玩家距离太远或者在上面，它们可以将玩家拉回来。

首要记住：如果你是仇恨目标，将它们带到坦克跟前，不要像无头苍鸡一样在房间里乱跑，这样一点也不会有帮助。

* **横劈** :  这个BOSS会发动一次横劈攻击，将武器挥向仇恨目标的方向。重要的是，BOSS在任何时候都应该面向小队之外，以避免攻击所有队友，仅对坦克攻击。阻挡可以有效避免这个攻击，但是小队成员不应该站在攻击范围内。如果你是DPS或治疗玩家，请站在BOSS后面。

* **窑炉** :  这是整场战斗中最重要的机制。窑炉/房间着火了，现在你必须在有限的时间内与时间赛跑。

在地面上的90%、60%和30%处，你将看到4个符文。

* **每个中都有1** : 4个可以看到的纹章。

上方有三个平台，每个平台上有一个抓钩点。

其中一条指引会告诉你你要找的是哪个符号或徽记。

玩家（输出和治疗或几个输出者）必须攀爬并找到符号。一旦找到，他们必须激活该符号。

这将向坦克揭示哪一个是真正的。它将会被一个旋转的视觉效果包围。

坦克必须将Boss定位在它下面。

当Boss到位时，团队必须打破Boss身上的伤害护盾，才能对其造成伤害。如果成功，Boss会将剑刺入地上的符文中，你们就都会安全了。

如果你失败了，整个团队都会被烧死。没有任何机会挽救，也无法通过治疗来逃脱惩罚。死就是死。

注意：如果你是在上方寻找符号的人，你必须保护自己免受弓箭手的攻击。他们会向着队伍射箭雨，所以留意脚下，不要死亡。

如果你做对了，你就安全了，如果你做错了，你就死定了。这是整个地下城中最严苛的机制之一，甚至可以说是最严苛的机制。





### 偷心者沃瑞亚

> VORIA THE HEART-THIEF


游戏 

**心脏窃贼维若丽亚？：秘密BOSS #2 **

这个首领是地牢中最有趣的之一，相对简单，但这场战斗中有一个巨大的风险，因为有一个抓钩机制。

坦克必须时刻维持嘲讽，而小队应尽可能站在Boss后面。

* **猛攻** :  这个首领会偶尔向坦克发起攻击。简单地格挡就可以了。

* **图腾** :  这个机制与第一个Boss相同。摧毁图腾或者不断承受伤害并死亡。

* **骨骼巨像** :  首领在生命值降至70-65%左右时会转化为骨骼巨像，变得更加强大。只要坦克拉住了仇恨，这只是嘴上说说而已。只需继续你正在做的事情，并确保你的治疗师有一些被动治疗效果持续作用，以防玩家在这个阶段受到范围伤害造成过多的伤害。

* **她要逃跑了** :  这个机制非常有趣，但人们往往会惊慌失措并很容易死亡。

这个首领会传送到你最开始来的地方并试图逃跑。她会在大约75％的时候这样做，然后再在大约40％左右回到你刚来的地方。

当她前往另一个岛屿时，你必须使用钩绳来跨越过去。

这是一种双重抓握机制，如果你行动太慢，就会掉落并死亡。

当你到达首领时，她会有一个伤害护盾和一个缓慢扩散的奥术区域效果在她的身下。你需要先打破她的伤害护盾，然后打断她的引导以停止她施法。如果你做到了这一点，战斗会继续进行。如果你失败了，她将逃脱并结束战斗，直到你下一次进入地下城并再次尝试为止。一定不能失败！

提示：按照视频中所述的方法大致对准镜头，不必100%准确，但如果你试图过于精确，就会感到恐慌，浪费时间并失败。





### 永恒盾灵

> ETERNAL AEGIS


攻略翻译如下： 

**永恒神盾**

这个BOSS有两种打法：以聚在一起输出伤害的方式或以安全的方式。你可以根据自己的喜好来选择打法，但最重要的是不要慌张。BOSS应该始终面向玩家团队外侧。

如果你的团队携带了大量减伤技能/装备/终极技能和足够的治疗，你们可以紧密地站在一起，轻松地对其进行攻击，即使团队中的伤害低，也能完成。

然而，如果你没有这种装备，而且你的队伍整体上都比较脆弱，那么应该遵循机制（如下所述）。

* **重击** :  这是一个普通的重击。如果你是坦克并且被攻击，一定要格挡。该攻击还会造成火焰伤害，所以当你格挡时要小心不要血量过低。如果你是一个输出/治疗职业，并且由于某些愚蠢的原因你负责仇恨...你必须闪避或者死亡。

* **投掷剑** :  BOSS会交叉双臂来准备使用强力的投掷剑技能。这和你之前见过的空气元素几乎一模一样。如果你看到它正在发生，你可以格挡这个攻击，或者干脆打断技能，这样BOSS就不会使用它了。

* **刷怪倒影** :  当BOSS的血量下降到90%、70%、50%和30%时，他会召唤4个刷怪/倒影，外观和他一样。基本上是他的迷你分身小兵。它们都会旋转，对所有被困在它们的AOE范围内的人造成快速的持续伤害。它们的AOE中间有一个间隙。如果你设法站在旋转范围的外面或者中间而不触碰AOE，那么你将不会受到伤害。

这里有两种选择：

Option 1:
In Kjalnar Tombskald, you will encounter Blastbones, Bor, Ri and Howler. Be cautious and try to take them down one by one, as they are a tough group.

在卡尔纳尔·墓歌中，你会遇到自爆枯骨、波尔、里和霍勒。要小心并尝试一次击败他们，因为他们是一组强大的敌人。

Option 2:
When facing Hakgrym the Howler, you should be prepared for his powerful Cleave attack. Also, be wary of Otten and Ondagore the Mad, as they are sneaky Ghosts that can catch you off guard.

当面对嚎叫者哈克格里姆时，你应该准备好面对他强大的横劈攻击。此外，要提防奥顿和疯狂的昂达戈尔，因为他们是狡猾的鬼魂，可以在你不经意间袭击你。

选择1：避开伤害区域并分散开来。先击败小怪再对付首领，等小怪死亡后再回来攻打首领。

选项2：直接站在boss下面，坚守阵地，尽可能地使用抗性、增益、伤害护盾、伤害降低和保护等措施来减少受到的伤害，同时保持强力治疗。如果你能够成功地保持生命力并实现这一点，你可以在每个阶段都进行堆叠和燃烧。

* **旋转** :  和小怪一样，这个BOSS也有一个毁灭性的旋转机制。圆圈中间有一个缺口。要么呆在缺口里，要么保持远离圆圈。无论哪种方法，选择权在于你。这完全取决于你从1或2中选择的选项。

注意：通常当小怪出现在房间里或同时进行它们的技能时，情况会变得不稳定。要小心。





### 疯狂的昂达戈尔

> ONDAGORE THE MAD


**疯狂的昂达戈尔**

这个首领拥有非常惩罚性的机制，是下一个让队伍垮掉的敌人。如果你不注意这些机制，你就会死亡。主坦克应该始终保持仇恨并将首领固定在房间中央，同时足够快地抓住任何新的增援。不要解除嘲讽。

还有，我希望你在挑战这个Boss之前已经练过你的Batman技能，因为你会需要它们！

* **骨巨像幽灵** :  在战斗中，首领会召唤幽灵小兵和一个巨大的骨巨像以及一些小型幽灵类型小兵。幽灵不太会造成问题，可能会在即使是低范围伤害的情况下死亡，但当然应该被击杀。

另一方面，必须聚焦攻击骨骼巨像。如果你没有击败它，你的小队可能会受到不同数量的反复攻击，这取决于你们的伤害输出。注意，这里的“骨骼巨像”指的是游戏中的一个敌对BOSS角色。

保护职业必须尽快嘲讽并将其留在Boss身边。这个巨人有一个毁灭性的重击攻击。

如果你是坦克，你可以格挡这个攻击，你会没事的（但即使格挡你也会被击退），然而，如果这个重击瞄准了一个输出或治疗角色，请不要格挡它，你100%会死亡。你必须非常小心地闪避它。

如果它开始酝酿攻击，记数3,2,1，然后躲避！太早或太晚都会导致死亡，它的攻击有非常精确的时机。

* **出去** :  当首领的生命值约为80%和约为40%时，首领将变得免疫并放出有毒气体充满房间！如果你留在这里，你会死亡！

每个玩家必须走出中间，并利用边缘的钩爪点来获得安全。

在某些随机点上会出现幽灵，必须将它们杀死。一旦所有幽灵都死亡，你就可以返回中央，因为烟雾会消退。

* **躲起来** :  当Boss的血量下降到大约60％（取决于输出）并再次下降到20％左右时，Boss将进入全幽灵模式。

基本上，他身边会有4个治愈者（幽灵），他们会通过连接来维持他的抵抗力和生命值。你必须杀死这些幽灵，以减少它们对他的控制。如果你杀死了所有的幽灵，这个阶段就结束了，但是每杀死一个，你就可以更猛烈地攻击他一次。其中一个幽灵名叫卡尔纳尔·墓歌（Kjalnar Tombskald），还有一个叫自爆枯骨（Blastbones）。在战斗中，你需要小心波尔（Bor）和里（Ri）这对协作的敌人，他们的攻击很危险。另一个幽灵名为霍勒（Howler），以及奥顿（Otten）。此外，还有嚎叫者哈克格里姆（Hakgrym the Howler）和疯狂的昂达戈尔（Ondagore the Mad）。如果你遇到了阿克（Ak），他会使用横劈（Cleave）技能进行横扫。

然而，在这个阶段，他正在蓄力进行巨大的爆炸，会使你晕眩并造成巨大的伤害。如果你被抓住了，你就会死亡。

在这里，你需要躲在柱子后面的抓钩点后面。如果你在它后面，同时它也发出黄色的光芒，那么你就会受到来袭爆炸的保护，如果没有，那么你就没被保护，会死亡。

因此，在这个阶段，请呆在柱子后面，击杀幽灵，等一切结束后再回到中间。

注：机制可能会重叠，请小心。有些人玩得冒险，有些人玩得保守。你对此的处理取决于你。





### 卡尔纳尔·墓歌

> KJALNAR TOMBSKALD


** 卡尔纳尔·墓歌 **

这个BOSS实际上比看起来要简单，但是他有一些会造成巨大伤害的攻击，能够摧毁小组中所有人，即使是最结实的坦克也难以承受。如果你是血量较低的坦克，你很可能会在这里死亡。我建议在这场战斗中提高一些生命值！

作为坦克，请确保始终嘲讽首领，并如视频所示，始终将其背对着团队。dps/治疗应该尽可能站在首领身后，并略微分散开来。

注意：在困难模式下，他的攻击力会大幅增强，并且他的血量从850万变为1800万!!

* **重攻击** :  首领会对坦克进行重攻击，这是一种造成很大伤害的技能，必须格挡。不格挡=坦克死亡，你不会活下来的。

* **掌握** :  这位首领会从坦克下面的地面上释放一个骷髅手。这可以被格挡（伤害方面），但除非使用不动如山，否则它会使坦克晕眩/被控制。坦克必须尽快解除控制。

这一攻击不仅可以直接击杀坦克，而且就算没有直接击杀，但如果和接下来的攻击重合，也足以致其于死地。

小心并注意！

* **Grave Dust** :  这个机制可能成为团队灭亡的关键，除非你知道如何处理它。首领会非常快地举起手，然后从他下面会出现多个快速移动的类似墓尘的效果，类似于狂潮第7轮中巨兽的跺脚攻击。然而，这些攻击威力非常强大！！

如果你非常快并且发现了它，你可以格挡它。如果你远离它，你可以躲避它，但是让我们把它变得简单一些，好吗？

这个攻击类型是魔法伤害。通过增益、奖励、组队和冠军点数来增加魔法抗性。如果你的魔法抗性非常高，你可以通过来自治疗的治愈效果轻松对抗这种机制，这样这个问题就解决了。

我仍然建议如果你看到它来了，就进行阻挡。

* **牢笼** :  这种机制是指BOSS会在地面上释放一堆类似笼子的岩石。如果你作为DPS/治疗留在这里超过一秒钟，那么你最好说晚安了。不要停留在这里，要快速离开。

它们会生成，然后迅速引爆，带来一种巨大的多米诺骨牌效应。这是一种生死攸关的机制。

* **矿洞** :  BOSS会同时施放多个闪电球（请注意，他通常会在此之前进行分散的AOE攻击，请小心脚下），这些闪电球将会在房间内的随机位置落地。当它们着陆时，它们将出现在地上，并呈现为角/骨头。非常简单，它们就是地雷！

不要站在那里！

* **骷髅自爆枯骨** :  在战斗期间，首领会召唤自爆枯骨和一名行动缓慢的双手持武器的骷髅。它们试图到达地面符文以获取更多力量。

主要集中火力攻击使用双手武器的敌人。加快击杀速度，同时也可以使用控制技能。如果在敌人到达中央位置之前不能将其击杀，他将会恢复全部生命值，再次对你造成麻烦。因此请集中攻击敌人。

如果可能的话，需要尽快杀死自爆枯骨。请记住它们是会爆炸的，所以你有选择的余地。

如果你杀死它们，它们当然会死亡。但是，如果它们能够到达符文而充能，它们会爆炸并造成巨大的范围伤害。其中的Ondagore the Mad和Hakgrym the Howler都可以在卡尔纳尔·墓歌中找到，如果你杀死它们，它们会变成自爆干骸（Blastbones）。请小心横劈（Cleave）和霍勒（Howler）的攻击。另外，你可能还会碰到鬼魂（Ghost），请小心应对。

如果你无法在时间内将它们击败，可以格挡伤害或者进行一个非常精准的闪避来完全避免它们的攻击。这需要一定的时机和练习，但如果你完成这个阶段，只需回到首领处继续进行，直到再次遇到它们。

这些技能都是有冷却时间的，所以战斗越长，这些技能就会使用得越频繁。如果你选择或只能躲避，要保持足够的体力。

这个阶段是最重要的，应该始终优先考虑。

这个BOSS没有官方的愤怒状态, 所以你可以花多长时间都可以, 只要你处理好那些机制并且不要死得太多, 而玩"复活游戏"。

* **大块头** :  如果你不喜欢突然恐怖场景，那就太糟糕了。这个首领展示了他非常懂得死灵法术，能够召唤出一个巨大的骨制巨像！

这个游戏的攻略是：它咬起来没有那么可怕，但你必须遵循一些基本的机制。

他偶尔会施放冰霜吐息，只需要闪避或者格挡来避免/减少伤害。

同时它会对单个目标释放一个火球，并在地面上放置一个巨大的AOE。只需避开它并不要站在其中。

注意：惊慌失措的玩家更容易被攻击。不要失去理智。

提示：在执行机制时，请不要更改。因此，如果你到了这个地方，你肯定可以做到。不要改变任何事情，专注于机制，继续做你正在做的事情。祝你好运！

> 
> This boss s ONLY able to be fought if you have killed the last two. The room is massive so you have a LOT of space but that is a a very good reason. There is going to be a lot to deal with.
> 
> The tank should focus on keeping the boss as central as possible and use the middle grapple hook as a pivot point. Keep the boss turned away from the group at all times and do NOT drop taunt.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will throw out a occasionally at the tank. Simply block this and you will be fine.
> 
> **Stomp!** - The boss will stamp the floor and place a huge damage over time aoe on the ground. Usually around 90% and 40%. Do NOT stand in this. Each time he places one, as the tank, you should shift around the grapple post pivot slightly ready to place the next one close to or overlapping it but in a safe space. If you spread out too much this can end up filling the room.
> 
> Here you must look for a SAFE platform and grapple to safety until the explosion is over. Once it has gone you can get back into the middle again.
> 
> **Skeletons** - After the stomp skeletons will spawn from the aoe sections. There will be a couple of small ones which are not really a problem and die to passive aoe, but there is ONE two hander. IF you do not kill him you are going to have problems. Overlapping mechanics will take over you and people will likely die.
> 
> This add must be taunted by the tank asap! He has a huge heavy attack and a dps/healer will not be able to block it, they must dodge roll if they are targeted or die.
> 
> **GOO!** - During the fight the boss will punch into the ground causing aoe circles to be placed on the ground (avoid these) but around the same time Large Ooze type enemies will spawn. These in the early stages will be fairly low health and mostly die to aoe damage, but as the fight goes on they get bigger and bigger!
> 
> Some end up with around 11m+ health!
> 
> You do NOT need to try to kill these doing 11million damage. If you grapple THROUGH the targets they will split in two. Making two smaller ones, rinse repeat till they are dead. You can physically kill them by grappling through them.
> 
> You can stack and burn the boss of course if you have high damage and mechanical awareness, but if following the mechanics, this can be a life saver as it can get a little hectic.
> 
>

> NABOR THE FORGOTTEN
> 
> 
> ** NABOR THE FORGOTTEN: SECRET BOSS #1 **
> 
> This boss is quite tricky but relatively simple. This will really test the ability of the players with the grapple hook mechanic (aka batman). The tank MUST maintain a taunt on the boss at all times and hold him as still as possible.
> 
> The dps/healers will have to be aware of their surroundings.
> 
> The boss will never move but the group will have to, so keep your eyes open.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will throw out a occasionally at the tank. Simply block this and you will be fine.
> 
> **Big BOOM!** - This mechanic is pretty simple but fiddly. The boss start channeling and the platform you are on and multiple others will have a spreading aoe on them. If you are standing on ANY of those platforms when it explodes, you will die and/or be thrown off the edge.
> 
> Here you must look for a SAFE platform and grapple to safety until the explosion is over. Once it has gone you can get back into the middle again.
> 
> **Adds** - After 75% the boss will spawn adds around the room. These archers are a BIG problem and they will try to take aim on random individual targets.
> 
> If they succeed they will throw the player off the edge and kill them.
> 
> During their channeled up take aim ability you have a few options to prevent it.
> 
> You can interrupt the target (close or long ranged).
> 
> You can have your tank pull them in to the fight and kill them with the boss.
> 
> OR the safe option is to have one of your dps work on the adds. Simply go to each add and kill them one by one to prevent them from nuking people.
> 
> How you deal with them is up to you and your group but be sure you 100% interrupt them while they channel or it is game over fast!g this phase you will have the fire, lightning and ice mechanics.
> 
> NON hardmode does NOT have the previous boss mechanics and adds. It is no where near as stressful. This will take practice so best of luck!
> 
> 
> 
> HAKGRYM THE HOWLER
> 
> 
> ** HAKGRYM THE HOWLER **
> 
> This boss is quite very although can appear quite intimidating and also can cause a big problem if the tank is not paying attention. His basic attacks are not so bad but his major mechanics can hit very hard! The tank should always maintain a taunt of course and turn the boss away from the group at all times!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will throw out a long winded heavy attack which does a very high amount of damage. If you are a dps/healer you must dodge roll this or you will die. However if you are the tank you must block this, BUT try to be sure you have full health or high health at the time. Blocking this at half health or low health especially if you are not a very chunky tank, will one shot you. If you are a very low health tank you may want to take the chicken approach on this one and carefully time a dodge roll to avoid it.
> 
> **Lich Crystals** - This mechanic is pretty simple. The boss will throughout the fight cast double lich crystals on the floor. There will be a spreading AOE and then an explosion once it peaks in size. Simply step out of these and don't let them hit you. Getting hit by one will take a dps/healer to at least half health but if they are already low or get hit by a couple at once they will die.
> 
> **Totem** - The boss will occasionally summon a Totem into the room. When you spot this you must kill it as soon as possible. If you do not, it will channel constant magical bolts of damage at the group. The longer this is up the more damage it does and could cause a potential wipe. Be sure to focus this down as soon as it is summoned.
> 
> **Malcoms! (flesh Abombinations)** - This mechanic is very simple. The boss at around the 70% and 20% health (depending on dps, you can overshoot this) he will teleport to the side of the room and release a flesh abomination! These are fairly lot health but must be killed asap. They have a huge spreading AOE slam on the ground that must be avoided. If you try to burn too fast and ignore these adds you will end up with two of them. Which is unnecessary. Kill them as they spawn and THEN carry on with the mechanics.
> 
> **Adds** - During the fight the boss will spawn undead wolves, be sure to kill these fast as they can put pressure on the group. The tank should try to hold these next to the boss to avoid them scattering around the room.
> 
> **Juffy mode! (transformation)** - At 0% health he will wolf out! The boss transforms into a Hulking Werewolf! This is where the fight gets a little scatty so do NOT panic. The same mechanics as above still persist, with the lich crystals and such but you do have a couple more mechanics to deal with.
> 
> **Stomp** - The boss will stamp on the ground causing a large spreading aoe on the ground. You must avoid this so simply step out of it when you see it.
> 
> **Charge!** - The boss will charge in the direction he chooses and will run all players in his path down, causing huge damage! You must avoid this.
> 
> Also as he charges, many undead adds will spawn and will have to be dealt with. The tank should try to stack these up while the group try to keep passive AOE damage down on the floor to help get them down as they spawn.
> 
> 
> 
> KEEPER OF THE KILN
> 
> 
> ** KEEPER OF THE KILN **
> 
> This boss IS straight forward but if you think you can skip mechanics, you had better think again. This is the pug killer of pug killers.
> 
> There is a simple rule in this fight above all. Follow the mechanics, or die!
> 
> There are four platforms on the ground and three grapple points up the top above your heads. These are very important.
> 
> The tank should hold the boss on one of the four concrete squares to start with and hold it still. The rest is as follows below. Do NOT drop taunt.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss has a fairly harsh heavy attack. If you are a tank you should have no issues blocking this and you won't take much damage. But a dps or healer will be one shot, so if for some reason this is aiming at you and you are NOT a tank, be sure to dodge roll it.
> 
> **Adds** -  Around the room there are many standing statues that you cannot interact with. These will come to life and join the fight at 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%.
> 
> The tank should grab these as soon as possible without spinning the boss and stack them all together. The group should focus these down as soon as possible.
> 
> Watch out for over burning on the dps side with the boss because otherwise you can end up with way too many adds in the room and it can be tricky to manage depending on your group.
> 
> Be sure to block if these adds try to heavy attack and be warned, they CAN chain players back in if they are too far away or up top.
> 
> Remember above all, if you have aggro, bring things to the TANK, do NOT run around the room like a headless chicken, it will not help at all.
> 
> **Cleave** - The boss will cast a cleave attack swinging his weapon in the direction of whoever has aggro. it is important that the boss is turned away from the group at all times so this is avoided and ONLY on the tank. Blocking this will be just fine, but the group should not be standing in it. Stay behind the boss if you are dps/healer players.
> 
> **The kiln!!!!** - This is the most important mechanic in the entire fight. The Kiln/room sets on fire, and you now fight against the clock.
> 
> On the ground at 90% 60% and 30% you will be presented with 4x runes.
> 
> Each one has a number of sigils visible inside of them from 1-4.
> 
> Up above are 3 platforms with a grapple point on each.
> 
> ONE of those points tells you WHICH symbol/sigil is the one you are looking for.
> 
> Players (dps and healer or a couple of dps) must grapple up and find the symbol. Once it is found, they must activate the symbol.
> 
> This will reveal to the tank WHICH one is the real one. It will have a swirling visual around it.
> 
> The tank must then position the boss on top of it.
> 
> When the boss is in place the group must break the damage shield the boss has on it in order for it to start taking damage. If successful, the boss will stab his sword into the sigil on the ground and you will all be safe.
> 
> If you fail, the entire group will burn to death. No coming back from it, no out healing. DEAD is DEAD.
> 
> Note: If you are one of the people up the top finding the symbol, you will have to protect yourself against archers. These also fire down at the group with arrow barrage so watch your feet and don't die.
> 
> If you do this correctly you are safe, if you do it wrong you are dead. This is one of if not THE most unforgiving mechanic in the entire dungeon.
> 
> 
> 
> VORIA THE HEART-THIEF
> 
> 
> ** VORIA THE HEART-THIEF?: SECRET BOSS #2 **
> 
> This boss is one of the most fun in the dungeon, relatively simple but there is a HUGE risk in this fight with the grappling hook mechanic.
> 
> The tank must maintain a taunt at all times while the group stay behind the boss if and when possible.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will throw out a occasionally at the tank. Simply block this and you will be fine.
> 
> **Totem** - This mechanic is the same as the first boss. Kill the totem or constantly take damage and die.
> 
> **Goliath!** - The boss will transform into a Bone Goliath for a few seconds at around 70-65% health, making her much stronger. So long as it is taunted by the tank this really is more mouth than action. Just keep doing what you are doing and be sure your healer has some passive HOTs running so people don't take to much damage during this phase form aoe damage.
> 
> **She's ESCAPING!** - This mechanic is SO much fun but people panic and die way too easy.
> 
> The boss will teleport to the place you first came from and is trying to escape. She will do this at 75% ish and then again around 40% she will travel BACK to where you just came from.
> 
> When she goes to the other island you must use the grapple to get across.
> 
> This is a double grapple mechanic where if you are too slow you will fall and die.
> 
> When you reach the boss she will have a damage shield and a slow spreading aoe under her. You need to break her damage shield first, THEN interrupt her to stop her channeling. If you do this the fight will continue. If you fail she will escape and the fight is over, you have failed until the next time you come into the dungeon and try again. Do NOT fail!
> 
> TIP: Aim your camera (as explained in the video) ROUGHLY in the area, you don't have to be 100% accurate, but if you try to be too precise you will panic, waste time and fail.
> 
> 
> 
> ETERNAL AEGIS
> 
> 
> ** ETERNAL AEGIS **
> 
> This boss can be done in two ways. The stack and burn way, or the safe way. Which way you choose is entirely up to you but the main thing you need to do is NOT panic. The boss should be turned away from the group at all times.
> 
> If your group has brought with it LOTS of damage mitigation skills/gear/ultimates and plenty of healing. you can stand together tightly stacked and nuke the hell out of it with ease, even with low damage in the group it is doable.
> 
> However if you do not have this and generally you are quite a squishy group, then mechanics should be followed (explained below).
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is a simple heavy attack. If you are the tank and this is on you be sure to block it. It will do fire damage as well so be careful not to be low health while blocking. If you are a dps/healer and for some stupid reason you have aggro...you must dodge roll it or die.
> 
> **Swords throwing** - The boss will cross his arms and power up a powerful sword throwing mechanic. This is basically identical to every air atronach you have ever seen. If you see this happening, you can block the attack, OR simply interrupt it and it won't happen.
> 
> **Adds/reflections** - At 90% 70% 50% and 30% health the boss will spawn 4x adds/reflections with the same appearance as him. Basically his mini me type minions. These will all spin and spin doing fast paced damage over time to anyone caught in their aoe. They all have a gap in the aoe in the middle. If you manage to stand outside of the spin or in the middle of it and not touch the aoe, you will be untouched.
> 
> Here you have 2 options.
> 
> Option 1: Stay out of the damage circles and spread out. Kill the adds separate from the boss and then come back in again after they are dead.
> 
> Option 2: Stack directly under the boss, hold your ground, stack as much damage mitigation as you can in form of resists, buffs, damage shields, maim and protection while maintaining HEAVY heals. If you can do this and stay alive successfully, you can stack and burn every single phase.
> 
> **SPIN!** - Just like the adds the boss has a devastating spin mechanic. The circle has a gap in the middle. Either stay in the gap, or stay way out of the circle. Either way they choice is yours. This all depends on which option from above of 1 or 2 you have chosen.
> 
> NOTE: The spin usually comes when the adds are in the room also doing theirs at the same time. Be careful.
> 
> 
> 
> ONDAGORE THE MAD
> 
> 
> ** ONDAGORE THE MAD **
> 
> This boss is the next pug killer with very punishing mechanics. If you don't pay attention to them, you are dead. Plain and simple. The tank should keep aggro at all times and hold the boss in the middle of the room while being fast enough to grab any new adds that spawn. Do NOT drop taunt.
> 
> Also i hope you practiced your batman skills before this boss, you are going to need them!
> 
> **Bone Colossus/ghosts** - During the fight the boss will spawn ghost adds and a massive bone colossus along with some small ghost type adds. The ghosts are not too much of a problem and can die to even low aoe damage but should of course be killed.
> 
> The bone colossus on the other hand MUST be focused. If you don't kill it you can end up with multiple over time depending on the damage in your group.
> 
> The tank MUST taunt this as soon as possible and hold it by the boss. The colossus has a massive devastating heavy attack.
> 
> If you are a tank you can block it and you will be fine (but it will knock you back even if blocking) however if this heavy attack is aimed at a dps or a healer, do NOT block it, you will 100% die. You must dodge roll it very carefully.
> 
> If it starts winding up, count 3, 2, 1 dodge! Too early and you die, too late and you die. It has a very precise timing.
> 
> **GET OUT!!** - At around 80% health and at around 40% health, the boss will become immune and toxic gases will fill the room! If you stay here you will die!
> 
> Every player must get out of the middle and use the grapple points around the edges to get to safety.
> 
> There are ghosts at certain random points and they must be killed. Once they are all dead you can return to the middle as the gas will have faded.
> 
> **HIDE!** - At about 60% health (depending on dps) and also again at around 20% the boss will go full wraith mode.
> 
> Basically he will have 4x menders (ghosts) around the room and they will be channeling him to keep his resistance and health up. You must kill the ghosts to lessen their hold oh him. If you kill them all the phase is over, but for each one you kill you can hit him a bit harder.
> 
> However, during this phase he is powering up for huge explosions that stun and cause massive damage. If you are caught you will die.
> 
> So what you need to do here is hide behind the grapple points behind the pillars. If the grapple point is glowing yellow while you are behind it also glowing, you are protected from the incoming explosion, if not, they you are not protected and you will die.
> 
> So, during this phase, stay behind the pillars, kill the ghosts, and then come back into the middle once it is all over.
> 
> NOTE: Mechanics CAN overlap so be careful. Some play risky, some play safe. What you do about that is up to you.
> 
> 
> 
> KJALNAR TOMBSKALD
> 
> 
> ** KJALNAR TOMBSKALD **
> 
> This boss is actually a lot simpler than it looks but there are some MASSIVE damage causing attacks that can and will wipe out the group and even the chunkiest of tanks. If you are a low health tank you are most likely going to die here. I would recommend stacking into some health in this fight!
> 
> As the tank be sure to taunt the boss at all times and as demonstrated in the video, ALWAYS turn him away from the group. The dps/healer should be behind the boss as much as possible slightly spread out.
> 
> Note: Hardmode he hits a LOT harder and changes his health from 8.5mil to 18mil!!
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will heavy attack the tank, this is a BIG hitting ability and MUST be blocked. no block = dead tank, you WON'T survive.
> 
> **Grasp** - The boss will cast a grasping skeletal hand from the ground under the tank. This can be blocked (damage wise) but unless using immovable will stun/cc the tank. The tank MUST break free as fast as possible.
> 
> The hit is not only capable of killing a tank outright but also if it didn't quite kill them, overlapping incoming mechanics will finish the job.
> 
> Be careful and pay attention!
> 
> **Grave Dust** - This mechanic is the pug killer mechanic unless you know how to manage it. The boss will raise his hand VERY fast, and from under him will be multiple fast moving Grave dust like effects. Similar to the stomp from the behemoth in maelstrom round 7. However, these hit incredibly hard!!
> 
> IF you are super fast and spot it you can block it. If you are at range you can weave away from it, but lets make it a bit simpler for you shall we?
> 
> The damage type of this is MAGIC damage. Stack heavy into spell resistance with buffs, bonuses, group and champion points. If you are stacking HIGH spell resistance, you can basically just fight through it with incoming heals and this mechanic never has to be a problem again.
> 
> I would still recommend blocking if you can see it coming though.
> 
> **Cages!** - This mechanic is where the boss will cast a cluster of cage like rocks on the ground. If you stay in this for more than a second as a dps/healer, you may as well say good night. Do NOT stand/stay in this, get out fast.
> 
> They spawn, and then rapidly explode with a massive domino type effect. This is a life or death mechanic.
> 
> **Mines** - The boss will cast multiple bolts (note he usually does a spreading burst aoe before this so watch your feet)all at once which will land in random locations all around the room. When they land they will appear to be horns/bones on the ground. This is very simple, they are land mines!
> 
> Don't stand in them!
> 
> **Skeletons/Blastbones** - The boss during the fight will summon Blastbones and a slow moving two hander wielding skeleton. They try to reach the runes on the ground for more power.
> 
> The main focus here should be on the two hander. Kill him fast, he can be cc'd also. If you don't kill him before he reaches the middle he will heal to full health and just be really annoying to deal with again. So focus him.
> 
> The blastbones need to be killed as fast as possible IF possible. Remember these are made to explode so you have a choice here.
> 
> If you kill them they will of course die, BUT if their reach the runes and power up they will explode doing HUGE aoe damage.
> 
> If you cannot kill these in time you can block the damage, or have a very well placed dodge roll and completely avoid them. This will take timing and practice but if you finish this phase, simply go back to the boss and carry on until it happens again.
> 
> These are on a timer however so the longer the fight the more it will happen. Maintain your stamina in case dodging is your choice OR only option.
> 
> This phase is the most important and should always take priority.
> 
> The boss has no official enrage, so you can take as long as you like so long as you deal with these mechanics when they happen and don't die too much playing 'res games'.
> 
> **BIG BOY!** - If you don't like jump scares, then too bad for you. This boss shows off how much of a necromancer he really is and summons a humongous bone colossus giant!
> 
> This has a bigger bark than bite but there are some basic mechanics you must follow.
> 
> He will cast a frost breath every so often, simply dodgeroll or block to avoid/mitigate the damage.
> 
> Also he will cast a fireball at one target and place a huge aoe on the ground. Simply avoid this and don't stand in it.
> 
> NOTE: panicking players running away are more likely to be targeted. Don't lose your head.
> 
> TIPS: During execute the mechanic do NOT change. So, if you got this far, it's inevitable that you can do it. Don't change a thing, focus mechanics and keep doing what you are doing. Good luck!
