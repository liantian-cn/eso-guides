### 法尔格拉文领主

> LORD FALGRAVN


**法尔格拉文领主（瘦身的瑞凯特）**

这个BOSS很简单...但他的血量巨大！他非常巨大！

这个游戏的机制需要一些协调、专注和理解，就像其他战斗一样，但基本上是一场耐久战。你能走多远并表现出色吗？还是会疲惫不堪失败？这才是真正的考验。

让我们来谈一下位置和策略的重要性。首先，老板没有前方AOE（范围攻击）/cleave（横劈）能力影响除坦克之外的任何人。因此，大多数时间将老板保持在房间中央是安全的，如果人们不小心站在他附近，也不会对游戏产生影响。然而，保持简单，如果你不是坦克，也不要站在他的面前。

一般来说，对于整个小队，要形成一个漂亮的广泛分散的圆圈！在这场战斗中不要堆叠。这会引起问题。在站立范围内使用任何技能时，有足够的空间，在治疗方面也会在这场战斗中起到很大的作用。这场战斗是被设计成没有正面的AOE技能的，这会让你认为你可以堆叠并燃烧。错了。距离是关键，找到一个位置，立足于此（稍后再谈）。

* **爪牙** :  首领会对坦克发动一个持续20秒的伤害效果。每次攻击都会使这个伤害更加强大。然而，他会频繁施放这个技能，并且会用新技能取消旧技能，因此只要维持仇恨，坦克很少会完全受到其效果。所以只要集中治疗就很简单了。然而，如果这个技能攻击了一个输出或治疗，那么最后的几次伤害将会瞬间造成致命伤害。你不能清除它！

* **中尉Njordal** :  在大约95％的时间（非常早期），这个小怪/副本BOSS将会出现。主坦克应将主要BOSS远离团队。离线坦克应该抓住这个小怪并靠在墙上。整个团队全力打击这个小怪！像对待Boss一样环绕它，很好地分散开，并将其视为当前的Boss战，直到它死亡。

他有四个主要机制，它们很容易理解。

* **Cleave** :  BOSS会用双手握紧的武器对着坦克砍，同时也会带有锥形AOE攻击，所以确保其他人不要站在攻击范围内！同时，攻击命中的人还会受到一个持续20秒的dot效果，该效果无法被清除。

* **召唤** :  首领会将他的剑刺入地面，并不断从地下召唤红色骸骨拳头（类似于未坟墓的怪物组和机制）。其中三个会一起爆炸，然后这种持续的频道会一直发生，直到他停下来并把剑从地面上拿出来。所有人需要做的就是移动双脚，避免小范围的爆炸伤害。

* **瞬移打击** :  这个技能与Spindleclutch II中的最后一名BOSS完全相同。BOSS会从一个玩家跳到另一个玩家并造成直接伤害。如果他瞬移到你这里，使用格挡。简单易行。

**注意！** 如果你离他太远，你将会受到惩罚！如果你这么做了，他将会用无法闪避和无法打断的眩晕锁定你。要注意你的脚下！

一旦小BOSS死亡，回到房间中央的主BOSS处，恢复原来的阵型/位置。

* **闪电爆炸** :  在战斗中，BOSS会同时以电击能力瞄准3个玩家，这是一个会对其他玩家造成伤害的AOE脉冲电击，因此你必须不要叠在一起，如果能避免就不要重叠。3秒后，玩家将爆炸，带有闪电的玩家将受到电击伤害。任何被这些AOE困住的玩家也会受到伤害，如果人们太愚蠢和恐慌就会造成团灭。放松，分散开来，不要伤害彼此。你可以站得离开得比较远，这样就永远不需要移动，或者稍微后退一下，以免与他人接触。

注意：你无法格挡这个伤害，但你可以使用伤害护盾来减轻一些伤害，同时使用抗性和伤害减免技能/加成/冠军点数。

* **雏菊连锁** :  当BOSS血量分别达到90%和80%时，它会开始聚集闪电，所有玩家都会遭受每秒钟的伤害。房间里有4个导管/灯（北、南、东、西）。当前活动的那个，所有玩家都需要跑到那里，并在导管和BOSS之间排成一条直线。 快！创造这个协调的雏菊连锁将会沿着导管震动，并在BOSS身上爆炸。这必须重复4次，以使所有的导管爆炸。完成后，您可以像往常一样继续站位。

注意：在这个阶段，Boss受到的伤害要少得多，你应该让治疗师进行重度治疗以弥补线路拉拽期间的任何松懈（是的，有些人可能会搞砸这个，所以要事先准备好！）。

* **每个人都想成为一只猫** :  当生命值降至70%时，我们将会遇到一种我所称的《猫歌舞团》机制。这时你要像电影中钢琴的场景一样，砸穿地面（参见视频😉）。当你降落到下一层时，你将被每个吸血鬼领主/骑士中的一个所迎接，然后在首领加入之前将他们全部消灭。

你现在已经见过的3种敌人类型，但它们都有自己的机制。

* **红衣骑士** :  这是一个牛逼的敌人，他可以愤怒并变成像BOSS一样的大小。当他这样做时，他的横扫攻击非常强力，任何人都不应该站在这个家伙的面前，只有坦克和你需要使用大治疗术！

* **苦涩骑士** :  这个小怪可以关押一个玩家。你需要攻击监狱并释放他们，以免他们爆炸死亡。如果你不确定该找什么或者一次发生太多事情而感到不知所措，就打开字幕！它会告诉你哪个玩家被关押了。

* **上古卷轴在线游戏攻略

血骑士** :  这个BOSS会在地上施放一个大的血十字形。当这个发生时一定要格挡它！你可以使用盾牌并格挡，但不能躲避！受到的伤害将施加一定伤害时间效果给玩家，并且每次伤害效果会变得更强。一定要确保治疗师保持清醒并及时治疗！

注意：每个被击杀的附加怪物会将他们的能力授予其他骑士，因此尝试同时杀死它们，以防止重复的机制。

值得注意的是，在剩余的战斗中，BOSS现在会吸收这些机制。因此，骑士的幽影会每隔一段时间出现，并随机拥有每个机制。然而，现在没有骑士可以赋予力量了，相反，BOSS会得到这个力量！使他的攻击非常强大并变得巨大！

打破监狱，注视脚下，强力治疗！

* **失血和血珠** :  在战斗中，首领会对每个玩家施加红色的失血效果，持续30秒。在此期间请尽量不要移动，每移动一步将会造成巨大的伤害。移动的玩家将会死亡！因此，只有在你真的非常必要的情况下，才移动，并且只在非常短的距离内移动。这里需要大量的治疗。

在这段时间内，会出现一个大的红色血块。任何被困在其中的人都会受到伤害。它是可以格挡的，但是如果可能的话，您绝对不想靠近它。它的范围非常小，但是还是要尽量避免。

* **凝固物** :  在上述阶段中，凝固物将会生成，并慢慢移动到房间中间的血球处！每一个到达血球的凝固物都会加强它。以上阶段结束后，血球将会爆炸并对所有玩家造成伤害，伤害值取决于有多少凝固物到达中间。请确保你的治疗和减伤很足够，以防你的伤害不够高，在阶段中无法摆脱大量的凝固物。

一旦它爆炸，会生成一个巨大的凝固物，必须被消灭，但可以被嘲讽。注意它的前置斩击，任何DPS或治疗者都不应站在它附近。

* **「貴族猫2」** :  上述机制将重复使用，直到你达到35％，然后地板会再次破裂到最终区域！有趣！现在最终机制出现了。

这里不再有血液机制和闪电机制，而是进入了完全增强模式。他可以回复高达40%的生命值，现在基本上是堆叠输出和大量治疗。但当然还有一个主要机制要考虑，除了BOSS的横扫/重击攻击更强之外。现在你还需要处理囚犯和拷问者。

* **受害者和酷刑者** :  在楼下的战斗中（每50秒钟），boss会释放头顶上方和周围区域的雾气，会出现两个受害者和两个酷刑者。

首领会有导向宝珠告诉你该去哪里，所以要跟随它们并快速行动。基本上你要找一个敌人去击杀。你可以分成小组去杀死两个折磨者，然后再回来，但必须明白这是如何运作的。

每个小怪都有100万的生命值，所以DPS检测非常低。你有30秒的时间来击杀它们。

如果你杀死了两个折磨者，那么受害者会在战斗中帮助你。如果你失败了，那么他们就会跳入战斗，并进行猛烈的双手攻击。这意味着你现在必须杀死他们，而且他们比楼上的版本更加强化。选择在你手中，但我建议你尽快杀死他们楼上的版本，让战斗变得更容易。

* **砸开** :  位置非常重要，一定要让boss保持在房间中央附近。如果他靠近楼梯任何地方，他会<strong>砸开</strong>它们，房间将会压垮所有人，全队灭亡。你必须让他保持在主要区域/场地。

* **处以死刑** :  由于你已经了解了上述所有机制，现在当然基本上是处以死刑模式。继续做你该做的事情，保持遵循机制的节奏，不管这需要多长时间都没有关系。然而，有一件非常重要的事情你必须注意。BOSS现在会不断地对团队产生范围伤害，并且伤害非常大！你必须确保团队在接下来的战斗中有强大的治疗。继续保持那些伤害减免奖励和那些治疗。

注意：这是范围伤害，因此范围伤害减轻技能，奖励和CP会生效！

* **困难模式** :  困难模式没有太多重大的改变，但是由于已经有很多要处理的事情，因此增加更多的难度可能会比较棘手，不过这些改变是非常重要的！

* **抓取骷髅拳** :  这个小boss现在会使用6只骷髅拳来施放骷髅拳/抓取机制，而不是原来的3只。

* **闪电** :  主要的闪电范围伤害机制现在可以影响6个人而不是3个。

* **重击横劈攻击** :  在最后阶段，Boss的横劈/重击会产生一个血球，需要避开。它有一个小范围伤害，并会一直留在房间里直至战斗结束。

* **死亡寻求者（复活机制）** :  如果你在顶层或第二层复活了另一个玩家，你将被拖到最低层，并且必须通过传送门找到出路，以便重新加入战斗！如果你在那里被任何敌人攻击，你必须闪避他们的攻击，但最重要的是要迅速返回。如果那里的任何东西击中了你，你就死了！

在困难模式下，Boss和迷你Boss的生命值大幅增加，但通常除了以上加成之外的机制都是完全相同的。你会惊讶于一些小差别可以产生如此大的影响，但确实如此。因此请多多练习。

这场战斗实际上没有DPS（伤害输出）检测，甚至囚犯部分的伤害输出也很低。只是时间较长。所以大家要全力以赴，祝你们好运！





### 屠夫扬迪尔

> YANDIR THE BUTCHER


**屠夫扬迪尔**

这个BOSS是一个爱扔玩具和进行嬉闹的大坏小孩！但是，他的嬉闹会造成很大的伤害！与这个BOSS打交道的方法相当简单，只需将他转向远离团队的方向，但是如果人们不注意并坚持基本技巧，就有很多“必杀技”机制需要应对。

坦克的基本准则是将首领背向队伍，这对大多数人来说显然是显而易见的，但仍然必须说一下，因为有些人会花很长时间在房间里四处奔跑。第一条规则是永远不要让首领对着队伍旋转。

团队需要松散地站在Boss后面，确保不是严格堆叠在一起。虽然在大部分战斗中严格堆叠是可以应付的，但有些机制会故意要求你稍微分开一些，如果你在那方面太晚就会死亡。请密切关注以下机制。

* **横劈** :  这个技能很简单，但是boss会施放一个大的横劈攻击并向坦克挥动他的武器。如果你是一个输出或治疗类型的玩家，不要站在这个技能的前面，因为它会击中锥形范围内的任何人，你无法幸存。坦克必须格挡，这也是为什么boss应该面向远离小队的主要原因！

* **重击** :  这个技能很直接，如果你对游戏有一定了解，你应该知道它的作用。它会造成很大的伤害！坦克应该用盾牌格挡，否则就会瞬间死亡。

* **炽热之握** :  如果你离BOSS太远，他会用锁链抓住你，不要逃跑！

* **狮鹫和海蝰** :  首领房间里会有几只宠物。起初你只会遇到一只，但随着时间的推移，它们会不断地生成。它们的跳跃攻击具有范围眩晕/击倒效果，但伤害也相当高。每当它们跳跃并猛击时，团队必须格挡。

每隔60秒就会刷新这些小怪物。如果你在一分钟内没能击杀掉其中一个，那么它们就会同时在房间内出现并激怒自己和首领。

这个首领也可以在小范围内治疗他们，所以这也可能会产生问题。没有所谓的“dps竞赛/检查”，但是如果您不专注，机制会逐渐叠加。因此，当这些小怪物出现时，我强烈建议将重点放在它们身上而不是首领身上。

还有一点需要注意，首领和其它小怪有时会获得冰盾。你必须攻击敌人来破去他们的盾牌。你只有16秒时间来完成这个操作，否则他们会在近战AOE中爆炸，人们会受到巨大的伤害甚至死亡。

再次强调，你的主要目标应该始终是清除这些小怪。

注意：这些小怪在血量降至50%及以下时将停止生成。

* **图腾** :  在整个战斗中，首领会召唤图腾！共有四种不同类型的图腾，必须尽快击杀。它们的生命值不算高，但对于小组来说，它们需要被视为主要目标。

这个机制的识别方法是，BOSS会像施法一样引导，然后抬起手。在此期间，他的手中会有4种颜色中的一种闪烁，代表他正在生成的图腾类型。有些很容易管理，而有些则非常致命。了解你现在面对的是哪一种图腾，并基于相应的图腾进行协调。

* **鸟身女妖图腾（蓝色）** :  这个图腾会不断地从不同方向随机释放移动的闪电/风AOE伤害。小队应该简单地前后移动，以避免站在这些AOE伤害之中，并摧毁图腾。

* **石像鬼图腾（黄色）** :  这个比较简单，图腾会向团队投掷石头。你需要格挡这些石头否则你会变成石头。当你变成石头时，你必须挣脱否则你将一直被晕眩。

* **龙图腾 红色** :  不需要火箭科学家也知道这意味着什么！没错...火焰！这些东西会转过身面对团队玩家并喷出巨大的火焰吐息。不要被困在其中。绕过它并离开声音范围，否则你就会死亡。有时这些会导致团队瞬间灭团。

* **毒图腾绿色** :  这是一个很危险的机制。不要聚集在一起，这是胜利与失败的主要区别。多个玩家(不是所有人)将被毒包围，每秒钟会对他们造成伤害，同时也会对接触和重叠负面影响区域的任何人造成伤害。尽管这个毒素可以被清除，但通常为时已晚。击杀那个图腾，远离彼此，然后回到位置。你可以在看到这个机制时协调分开或者一直保持分开，但这些图腾是一个很重要的优先目标。如果你不杀死它，人们将不得不一遍又一遍地重启这个战斗！集中注意力！

* **攻略翻译如下
跳跃** :  当boss的血量减少到50%时，接下来的战斗中他会随机跳跃至仇恨最高的人身上（通常是坦克）。当他跳跃时，需要使用格挡技能来擦掉伤害。不要站得太密集，否则其他人可能会挡在你面前。

* **闪电** :  就像在机会来临的路上的自然闪电一样，当boss的血量降到50％以下并且在余下的战斗中，组内玩家会受到不断的闪电伤害。不要聚在一起，确保治疗持续，并且人们不要聚太紧而没有保持治疗。否则这将会对队伍造成很大的伤害。

* **困难模式** :  对于困难模式，以上机制会有一些额外的变化和加强。

如果你完全理解了这场战斗的基本知识，那么困难模式并没有太大区别，但你需要根据一个主要变量略微不同的策略来进行。在战斗一开始进入的房间里，不仅BOSS的血量更多，而且房间里会出现一种萨满类型的小兵。这个小兵必须被击败。它会将他的手插到空中，将流星降下到团队中的个别玩家身上（而不是所有玩家）。当这些流星降下时，受影响的玩家需要格挡！如果你不格挡，你会被击倒并承受巨大的伤害。然而，如果你是一个脆弱的玩家，那么你基本上就会被一击致命。不要搞砸了这个战斗！

* **此外即使这个家伙死了之后40** : 45秒另一个家伙会不断生成，而且在整个战斗过程中会一直如此。

有些人喜欢像非困难模式一样集火Boss，而忽略法师，当流星降落时只需简单地阻挡即可，但这需要严格的协调和恰当的机械处理。

然而，应对它们的简单方法是将首领（由坦克）移动并放置在新出现的小怪身上。每个小怪都有单独的出生点，应用这个方法的简单方式是理解它们会按顺时针的位置出现。所以，如果你现在正面对着首领，第一个出生点在你的右侧...然后顺时针转，下一个在右侧，依此类推。

这在视频中已经演示，但你所采用的方法/策略完全取决于你。

提示：执行……你应该做什么？我在这个游戏中给你的最重要的提示，应该适用于所有的Boss战。'继续做你正在做的事情！' 改变战术，喊着'放技能吧兄弟'或者像个白痴一样惊慌失措，摆出各种花样，简直会引起灭团！

你已经走到了这一步......你没有必要改变你正在做的事情。没有什么变化。这个简单的技巧将会让你区别于一个节奏良好、熟练、机械技术熟练的攻略和几周的压力。 #事实! :D





### 威若船长

> CAPTAIN VROL


**威若船长**

* **这个首领的应用有些简单但时间却很关键人们需要了解机制发生的方式和时间就像上一场战斗一样这次战斗也是完全5050的这意味着100** : 50%是战斗的一半，然后50-0%是另一半。没有过于压倒性的奇怪生命值百分比来触发机制。如果你可以把首领的血量从50%降到40%，那么你就可以把它降到0%，因为此时没有什么变化。只要练习并不要惊慌失措。惊慌会害死人！

为了简单起见，请确保那个小组在boss后面形成半圆形队列，而不是完全挤在一起（太紧密的堆叠会杀死你，分散开但保持在治疗范围内）。Boss应该一直在中间，背对着小组。

* **重击** :  这个很简单。坦克，格挡它！不格挡你会死！

* **凛冽迷雾冰** :  首领会瞄准一名玩家，在地面上释放一片冰霜范围攻击。这可以被躲避。然而，如果有人被击中，他们将会被眩晕/冻结并需要解除。这片范围很小，但会在地面上停留一段短时间。IF ANYONE（任何人）站在这里，首领会在这段时间里获得一个无法被破坏的护盾。一定要确保不要站在这片范围内，否则将延长战斗时间！

* **震荡鱼叉导线** :  每45秒一次，boss会将他的鱼叉扔给最远的玩家，并将其插入地面，形成一条必须击杀的闪电导线。随着时间的推移，玩家将逐个被绑定在上面，形成一个闪电链。如果导线存活的时间越长，玩家将会承受更多的伤害，在最终死亡之前。这是一个极其重要的目标，必须优先攻击。虽然其血量并不是特别高，但在玩家被闪电链束缚之前，只剩下几秒钟的时间。无论发生什么情况，一定要时刻准备，并优先击杀导线。

提示：当人们在弹道区域时，这个攻击可不幸地落在他们身上，因为他们是最远的。虽然抽签运气有时是人们接受的，他们也不介意与 RNG 跳舞……但尽量和团队协调好时间，当每个球ista都降落时，人们才能安全地使用弩车。在团队中有一个良好的心理或口头时钟来注意这一点。如果你可以在45秒内发射两个弩车，那就这么做，但如果你时间紧迫，请在下一支矛出现之前回去。否则你会在那里死去！请参考以下关于弩车的内容。

* **弩车** :  战斗附近有几个装有弩车零件的桶。房间两边还有2个弩车。在战斗期间，玩家需要收集这些零件来修复弩车并发射一支箭，然后再去收集更多的零件进行修复。这是后续机制中必须熟悉的内容。

注意：你可以在游戏开始时或任何时间拾取零件，并将其保存直到你准备好奔向弩车并使用它们。因此，你可以提前计划。你可通过视觉上的方式了解是否有弩车部件，即你/其他人会背着一个巨大的背包！是的，多人可以同时完成这个任务。

* **召唤师** :  战斗中，每隔45秒，一名召唤师将出现在海上的船上，并引导一个传送门！这个传送门会在队伍旁边打开，然后3个小怪从里面出现。虽然这些小怪需要被击杀，但一个玩家可以利用传送门，跳到船上与召唤师一起战斗。这名玩家需要独自击杀小怪，并维持自身的生存能力。但是，如果其他玩家想要帮助他们，他们可以从弩炮上射击召唤师！召唤师需要承受2次弩炮的攻击才能被击败，或者一次弩炮攻击加上一些来自其他玩家的伤害，或者只是独自英勇前往。派遣你最有能力的玩家到那条船上，你的问题就解决了。

在进行此操作的同时，需要处理陆地上的附加敌人。非常重要的是，你要认识敌人的种类和机制。在这个团队中，有两个弓手，如果他们向后翻滚，就会开始引导。打断他们是防止他们完成引导的主要机制，并且是你的优先考虑。如果没有打断他们，他们将会变得狂暴！

还要注意打断药剂师，因为他们会治疗首领。同时还要注意脚下，因为他们会在地上施放火焰。

直到主BOSS的血量降至50%，每45秒，魔法师和传送门将与小兵们一起重生。

* **萨满祭司** :  还记得第一个Boss hard mode里的萨满祭司吗？如果只通了普通模式，那这个新内容也许对你来说会是全新的。请认真注意，因为这会改变游戏进程！

在Boss血量降至50%以下时，不再会出现Conjurer和传送门。取而代之的是会在船上生成一种叫做Shaman的随从，总共有三个。他们会聚集力量，并朝团队成员头顶释放陨石。如果你身上有陨石，必须格挡，否则你将会被眩晕、击倒或者直接击杀。Shaman的数量越多，释放的陨石也就越多。

你猜对了，这就是弩车真正发挥威力的地方。双重弩车都需要修理、射击、修理、射击，反复进行，以确保这些幽影始终死亡。每个萨满祭司都会射出一发箭，但它们每45秒重生一次，你不想被它们压垮。如果能高效地处理弩车，流星机制就永远不会发生。否则，你将遭受火球的轰击并全部死亡。

提示：记住电击矛/鱼叉每45秒会发射一次，萨满祭师现在也每45秒生成一次。因此，在对他们施加压力的同时，你也必须确保在鱼叉射出时不要匆忙冲向悬崖。让它落在队伍中，然后再跑。记住最远的目标才是优先攻击对象。不要让你成为攻击目标！

* **闪电双子** :  当首领剩余50%的血量及以下时，他会定期在他身旁生成一个他的闪电双子。他会把自己连接到拥有首领仇恨的人身上，因此确保坦克拥有首领仇恨，否则小组中的一个玩家会拥有首领仇恨，你无法嘲讽它们！当它们还活着时，它们会有基础攻击并造成轻微不便，然而在战斗中，如果它们不死，其他人将一次又一次地生成。这可以无论你产生了多少个都可以完成，但如果你有困难，请简化操作，直接杀死它们。如果你不断地杀死它们，你仍然会慢慢击败首领，并且他个人没有DPS检查，只要你保持对其他周围机制的关注，可以按照自己的节奏进行。

这对闪电双子会给团队带来一个主要问题，那就是只有一个可被打断的机制。如果他在吟唱，你必须打断他，否则他会朝着自己面朝的方向施法一道冰/水波，造成伤害并将被击中的人击倒。AOE打断技能在这种情况下非常有效，尤其是如果你遇到多于一个双子时，但这个机制很简单，却很致命。一旦你不能持续打断，就会面临失败的可能性！在这场战斗中请带上你基本的技能机制！逐步打断！

从这里开始，在战斗中什么都不会改变。所以继续你正在做的事情！

* **困难模式** :  困难模式与普通模式有一些小区别。首先，当然，首领的生命值更高，但是也有不同的小怪需要处理。

当小怪从传送门中出现时，你也会得到壁垒。这些怪物与其他垃圾拉取中的怪物一样，遵循简单的机制。它们携带着一个保护盾。它们本身没有受到保护，但是盾牌中的任何东西在盾牌消失之前不会受到伤害。所以一定要将壁垒作为你的主要目标重点关注。其他的仍然可以被中断，所以不要忽略机制的这一部分，但是这些必须先死亡，或者从队伍中拿出来，然后再杀其他怪物。由于它们每45秒就会刷新一次，所以最好立即处理掉它们。

还有一件事需要注意，在整个战斗中，雷电将随机直接攻击小队中的玩家，并附带一个小范围伤害。不要站得太靠近！

> 
> This boss is SIMPLE...however, he has a TRUCK LOAD of health! He is BIG!!!
> 
> The mechanics require some coordination, focus and understanding much like any other fight, but it is an endurance fight basically. Can you go the distance and perform? or will you get fatigued and fail? That is the real test.
> 
> So let's talk importance of positioning and tactics for the most part..The boss has ZERO frontal aoe/cleave abilities that affect anyone other than the tank. So it is safe to hold the boss in the middle of the room the majority of the time and not a game changer if people accidentally stand near him. However, keep it simple, if you are not a tank...don't stand in his face anyway.
> 
> Generally for the rest of the group, make a nice wide spread out circle! Do NOT stack in this fight for the majority. It will cause problems. Plenty of space while standing in range of whatever abilities you are using,  and in the heals will make a big difference in this fight. It is designed (no frontal aoe) to make you THINK you can stack and burn. Wrong. Distance is key, find a spot and plant your feet (more on that later).
> 
> **Claw** - The boss will hit the tank with a 20second damage over time ability. This will get stronger and stronger per tick. However, he will cast this a lot, and will actually cancel out the old one with a new one so the tank will rarely get the full effect of it so long as they maintain aggro. So pretty simple to out heal if focused. If this hits a dps or healer however, those final ticks will literally one tick BOOM and kill you. You cannot cleanse it!
> 
> **Lieutenant Njordal** - Around 95% (very early on) this add/miniboss will spawn. The main tank should hold the main boss away from the group. The off tank should grab this and back against a wall. FULL focus damage on this boss from the whole group! Literally circle him like you did the boss, nicely spread out and treat this as your current boss fight until he is dead.
> 
> He does have 4 major mechanics and they are simple to understand
> 
> **Cleave** - The boss will cleave with his two hander in the direction of the tank. This DOES have a  conal aoe attached to it so make sure no one else stands in it! This also has a 20second dot applied to anyone hit by it which cannot be purged.
> 
> **Summoning** - The boss will stab his sword into the ground and constantly summon red skeletal fists from the ground ( like the monster set and mechanic from unhallowed Grave). Three of these will burst at once and then constant channels of this will happen over and over until he stops and takes his sword out of the ground. All people need to do is move their feet and avoid the BURST damage that comes from them in small aoe.
> 
> **Teleport Strike** - This is exactly the same as the last boss in Spindleclutch II. The boss will jump from one player to the other hitting them with direct damage. If he teleports to you, BLOCK it. Simple.
> 
> **Grip!** - You will be punished for moving too far away from him! If you do, he will chain you in with an undodgeable unbreakable stun. Watch your feet!
> 
> Once the miniboss is dead, go back to the main boss in the middle of the room and resume your original formation/positions.
> 
> **Lightning pop!** - During the fight the boss will target 3 players at once with a shock ability, this is an aoe pulsing shock that WILL hurt other players, so you must NOT stack and must NOT overlap them if you can help it. After 3 seconds they will burst and the players with lightning on them will take shock damage. Anyone caught in these aoes will ALSO take damage, resulting in wipes if people are stupid and panic. Relax, spread out, don't kill each other. You can position wide so you never need to move, or simply step back a bit so you don't hit people with it.
> 
> NOTE: You cannot block the damage from this but you can apply damage shields to help mitigate some of it as well as resistance and damage mitigation skills/bonuses/cps.
> 
> **DAISY CHAIN!!!** - At 90% health and 80% health the boss will charge up channeling lightning from the sky and every single player will take damage per second. There are 4 conduit/lights in the room (north south east west). Whichever one is currently active, all players need to run to and make a straight line between the conduit and the boss. FAST!! Creating this co-ordinated Daisy Chain will send a shock all the way down the light and POP on the boss. This must be done 4 times so that all conduits explode. Once completed you can resume positions as usual.
> 
> NOTE: The boss takes MUCH less damage during this time and also you should have your healers play heavy heals during this phase to cover up for any slack while drawing that line (yes some people can mess this up so always come prepared!).
> 
> **Every body want's to be a cat!** - At 70% we have what i like to call the Aristocats mechanic! This is where you basically smash through the floor (much like the piano scene in the movie, see video 😉 ). When you land on the next floor you will be greeted bye one of EACH of the Vampire lords/knights and have to kill them all before the boss joins you.
> 
> The 3 enemy types you HAVE seen before now however they do all have their own mechanics.
> 
> **Crimson Knight** - This is the BIG one, he can enrage and grow to the size of the boss. When he does this his swipes hit VERY hard, no one should be standing in front of this guy but the tank and you need some BIG heals!
> 
> **Bitter Knight** - This add can imprison a player. You need to attack the prison and break them free before they explode and die. If you are not sure what to look for or are generally overwhelmed by many things going on at once, put subtitles on! It will tell you when a player is imprisoned.
> 
> **Blood Knight** - This boss will cast a large blood cross shape on the floor. When this happens be sure to BLOCK it! You can shield and you can block but you cannot dodge it! Damage taken from this will apply a 7 second damage overtime to the players and will get stronger per tick. Be sure the healers are awake and on point!
> 
> NOTE: Each add killed will grant their power to the other knights, so try to kill them all at the same time to prevent duplicated mechanics.
> 
> Also note for the remainder of the fight the BOSS now absorbs these mechanics. So a shade of the knights will appear periodically with a random mechanic of each. However, while there is no Knight to empower anymore, instead, the BOSS will get it! Making him hit very hard and grow HUGE!
> 
> Break prisons, watch feet, big heals!
> 
> **Hemorrhage and Blood orb** - During the fight the boss will cast red blood visual type debuffs on each player for 30seconds. During this time try NOT to move. Every step you take will cause HUGE damage. Moving players will DIE! So only move if you really really must, and only if it is a VERY short distance. Big heals will be required here.
> 
> During this time a BIG red blood blob will appear. Anyone caught under this will take damage. It is blockable but you do NOT want to be anywhere near this if you can help it. The aoe from it is very small range wise but avoid it all the same.
> 
> **Coagulants** - During the above phase coagulants will spawn and move slowly to the middle of the room towards the Blood orb! Each one that makes it to the orb will empower it. After the Above phase is over the orb will burst and do damage to all players based on how many coagulants made it to the middle. Be sure you have PLENTY of heals and damage mitigation in case your damage is not high enough to get rid of a lot of them during the phase.
> 
> Once it explodes are LARGE coagulant will spawn and must be killed but CAN be taunted. Be aware of it's frontal cleave, no dps or healer should be standing near it.
> 
> **Aristocats part II?** - The above mechanics will be rinse repeat for as long as it takes until you hit 35%, THEN the floor will break again down to the final area! FUN! Now the final mechanics come in.
> 
> The blood mechanics no longer happen down here, nor does the lightning. Instead he is FULL empower mode. He will heal up to 40% health and now it is basically stack and burn with massive heals. BUT there is of course ONE more major mechanic to consider aside from the fact the boss's swipe/heavy attacks hit harder. You now have to deal with prisoners and torturers.
> 
> **Victims and Torturers** - During the fight downstairs (every 50seconds) the boss will release the mist above your head and around the area and there will be a 2 victims and 2 torturers.
> 
> The boss will have orbs directing you to where to go, so follow these and act fast. Basically you are looking for an enemy to kill. You can split up onto small groups to go and kill two torturers and then come back again but MUST understand how this works.
> 
> The adds have 1mil health each so the DPS check is very very low. You have 30seconds to kill them.
> 
> IF you kill both Torturers, the victims will help you in the fight. If you FAIL, then they will jump into the fight and cast HARD hitting two hander attacks. Meaning you must now kill these and they are buffed vs their upstairs version. The choice is yours but i would recommend killing this nice and quick upstairs and make the fight easier for yourself.
> 
> **SMASH!!!!!!!!!!** - Position is everything, KEEP that boss near the middle of the room. If he is anywhere near the stairs, he will SMASH them and the room will come crushing down effectively on everyone. It is a GROUP wipe. You must keep him in the main pit/area.
> 
> **Execute** - Since you know all of the above mechanics you are of course basically in execute mode now. Keep doing what you are doing, KEEP following the mechanics, and it doesn't matter HOW long this takes. However, there is ONE major thing you MUST be aware of. The boss is now constantly pulsing aoe damage at the group, and it hits VERY hard! You must be sure that the group has huge heals for the rest of the fight. Keep up those damage mitigation bonuses and keep up those heals.
> 
> NOTE: It is aoe damage so aoe damage mitigation skills, bonuses and CPs DO apply!
> 
> **HARDMODE!** - There are not many MAJOR differences in hardmode but there is already a lot going on so adding more spice can be tricky, but the changes are important!
> 
> **Grasp/Skeletal fists** - The miniboss now casts the Skeletal fist/grasp mechanic with 6 skeletal fists instead of 3.
> 
> **Lightning** - The main lightning aoe damage mechanic is now on 6 people not 3.
> 
> **Heavy/Swipe Attack** - At the last phase the boss's cross swipe/heavy attack places a blood orb which should be avoided. it has a small aoe to it and will stay in the room for the rest of the fight.
> 
> **DEATH SEEKERS! (Resurrection mechanic)** -  If you are at the top floor or the second floor and you resurrect another player, you will be dragged down to the lowest level and have to find your way out via a portal so you can rejoin the fight! If you are attacked by any enemies down there you MUST dodge roll their attacks, but above all get back quick. If anything down there hits you, you are dead!
> 
> On hard mode the boss and the miniboss have a MASSIVE amount more health, but generally the mechanics exeluding the additional above ones, are EXACTLY the same. You would be surprised how a couple of small differences can make that much of an impact, but it can. So practice practice.
> 
> There are technically no DPS checks in this fight and even the Prisoners section is really low. It's just LONG. So get stuck in people, and GOOD LUCK!

> YANDIR THE BUTCHER

> 
> ** YANDIR THE BUTCHER **
> 
> This boss is a big bad baby who likes to throw his toys out of his pram and jump up and down having tantrums! However, those tantrums HURT! This boss can be dealt with in a rather straight forward manner by sticking to the basics and turning him away from the group, but there are a LOT of 'killshot' mechanics if people don't pay attention and stick to their base game basics.
> 
> General rule of thumb is for the tank to turn the boss away from the group, that of course is obvious to most but still must be said because some spend a long time running around the room. Number 1 rule, NEVER spin the boss on the group.
> 
> The group need to be positioned LOOSELY behind the boss making sure they are not strictly stacked. While stacking is something you could technically get away with for the majority of the fight, there are some mechanics that will intentionally require you to separate a bit and if you are too late doing that you will die. Pay close attention to the following mechanics below.
> 
> **Cleave** - This is pretty simple but the boss will cast a big cleave attack and swing his weapon at the tank. Do NOT get in front of this if you are a dps or healer type since this will hit anyone in the cone and you will NOT live through it. The tank must block and this is the main reason why the boss should be faced away from the group!
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is pretty straight forward and if you got this far in the game you already know what it does. It hurts! The tank should block this or basically take a one shot.
> 
> **Fiery Grip** - If you are too far away from the boss he will chain you in, don't run away!
> 
> **Gryphon and Sea Adder** - The boss has a couple of pets in the room. To start with you will have one but over time they will consistently spawn. They have jump attacks which have aoe stun/knockdowns but also hit pretty hard. Whenever they jump and slam the group must BLOCK.
> 
> These adds will spawn every 60 seconds, so if you do not kill one within 1 minute you will end up with both in the room at the same time and they will enrage themselves and the boss.
> 
> The boss can also heal them within a small AOE radius so this can also be problematic. There is no 'dps race/check' as such, but of course the mechanics will start stacking if you do not focus. So i highly recommend FOCUSING these adds over the boss when they are present.
> 
> One more thing to note, the boss and the adds will occasionally receive an ice shield. You must damage the enemies to break their shields. You have 16 seconds to do this else they will go BOOM! in close quarter aoe and people will take HUGE damage and/.or die.
> 
> Again, your main focus should always be on getting rid of these adds.
> 
> NOTE: These adds will stop spawning at 50% health and under.
> 
> **Totems** - Throughout the fight the boss will summon totems! There are four different types and each must be killed as soon as possible. They don't have a huge amount of health but they need to be considered PRIMARY targets for the group.
> 
> The way to spot this mechanic is the boss will channel like he is casting a spell and then raise his hand into the air. During this time he will have one of 4 colours glowing in his hand to represent the TYPE of totems he is spawning. Some are easy to manage, others are deadly. Know which ones you have and co-ordinate based on the appropriate totem.
> 
> **Harpy Totem (blue)** - This will constantly channel moving lightning/wind aoes from the totem randomly in different directions. The group should simply move back and fourth to prevent standing in these aoes while destroying the totem.
> 
> **Gargoyle Totem (Yellow)** - This one is pretty simple, the totem will cast rocks at the group. You need to block these or you will be turned to stone. You MUST break free when you are turned to stone else you will stay stunned.
> 
> **Dragon Totem (red)** - Doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what's coming with this one! You guessed it...FIRE! These things will turn and face players in the group and emit a MASSIVE flame breath. Do NOT get caught in this. Move around it and get out of the path or die. These can sometimes be responsible for MASS insta wipes.
> 
> **Poison Totem (Green)** - This is the pug killer. This ONE simple mechanic and the main reason to NOT stack in this fight, is the difference between winning and losing. Multiple players (not all) will be surrounded by poison. Which will do damage to them every single second...and also will do damage to ANYONE they touch and overlap the negative aoe with. While this poison can be purged, it is usually too late. Kill that totem, stay AWAY from each other and then get back into position. Whether you co-ordinate splitting up when you see this or stay apart all the time anyway, it's totally up to you but these totems are an aggressive priority and if you don't kill it, people are going to be restarting this fight over and OVER! Focus!
> 
> **Jump** - When the boss hits 50% health, for the remainder of the fight he will randomly jump at the person with aggro (should always be the tank). Basically when he jumps in the air, BLOCK it for when he lands on you. Don't stack too hard because others will get in the way!
> 
> **Lightning** - Much like the environmental lightning on the way TO this fight, there will be constant lightning splashes on players in the group when the boss hits 50% and below and for the remainder of the fight. Don't stack to tightly and be sure that heals are constant, this will hurt a lot if people start stacking too hard and don't keep up the heals.
> 
> **HARDMODE** - There are some additions/variations to the above mechanics for hard mode.
> 
> IF you fully understand the basics of this fight, hardmode is not that different but you will have to approach it SLIGHTLY different based on ONE major variable. In the room from the very beginning of the fight, not only will the boss have more health but there will be a Shaman type add in the room. THIS target needs to die. It will channel his hands into the air and bring down meteors to individuals (not all players) in the group. When these are fired, the players affected will need to BLOCK! If you don't block you will be knocked down and take HUGE damage. If you are a squishy, squishy however, you will basically die to a one shot. Don't mess this up!
> 
> Additionally even when this guy is dead, another will spawn between 40-45 seconds later. Constantly throughout the fight.
> 
> Some people like to stack and burn the boss like the non hardmode and ignore the mage while simply blocking when the meteors comes down, but that will take some serious coordination and well timed mechanics.
> 
> However, a simple way to deal with them, is to MOVE the boss (as the tank) and place it on TOP of the add when it spawns. Each one has an individual spawn point and the easy way to apply this method is to understand that they will spawn in clockwise locations. So if you are facing the boss right now, the first spawn is on the right of you....then turn clockwise, again next one is on the right, and so on and so forth.
> 
> This is demonstrated in the video but the method/strategy you apply is 100% up to you.
> 
> TIP: Execute...what should you do? Biggest tip i will ever give you in this game and should be applied on ALL boss fights. 'keep doing what you are doing!' Changing stuff, shouting 'nuke it bro' or panicking like an idiot throwing shapes like you are going out of fashion, literally CAUSES wipes!
> 
> You got this far...you have no reason to change what you are doing. Nothing changes. This simple tip will make the difference between a well paced, practiced, mechanically aware clear, and weeks of stress. #FACT! :D
> 
> 
> 
> CAPTAIN VROL
> 
> 
> ** CAPTAIN VROL **
> 
> This boss is somewhat simple in application but timing is of the essence. People need to understand how and when mechanics happen. Much like the last fight, this is literally 50/50. Meaning 100-50% is one half of the fight, and then 50-0% is the other half. No massively overwhelming awkward health percentages for mechanics. If you can get the boss from 50% to 40%, you can get it to 0% because at that point nothing changes. Just practice and don't panic. Panic kills people!
> 
> So to keep things simple, be sure that that group is in a semi circle formation behind the boss, NOT fully stacked (tight stacking will kill you, spread out but stay in heals). The boss should be held in the middle turned away from the group at all times.
> 
> **Heavy attack!** - This is very simple. Tank, block it! Not blocking will kill you!
> 
> **Frigid Fog/ICE!** - The boss will aim at a player casting a frost aoe on the ground. This can be avoided. However, if anyone is hit by it they will be stunned/frozen and need to break free. The aoe is small but will stay on the ground for a short period of time. IF ANYONE is standing in this, the boss will receive an unbreakable shield during this time. Be sure NOT to stand in this aoe, else you will make the fight last longer!
> 
> **Shocking Harpoon/conduit** - ONCE every 45 seconds the boss will throw his harpoon at the furthest player and it will stick into the ground creating a lightning conduit that must be killed. Over time players will be individually tethered(one after another)  to this with a lightning chain. The longer it is alive the more damage they will take before inevitably killing them. This is an EXTREME PRIORITY target, this MUST be focused. While the health on it is not particularly high, you are only given a few seconds before the tether starts to nuke people in mass. ALWAYS be ready for this and always kill it regardless of whatever else is going on.
> 
> TIP: When people are up at the ballistics, this CAN unfortunately land on them there since they are the furthest away. While luck of the draw is something that people sometimes accept and they don't mind dancing with RNG...try to co-ordinate with the group and time this so that when each one LANDS, that is when people are safe to go use the ballista. Have a good mental or vocal clock in the group to keep an eye on this. If you can fire two ballistas in 45seconds, so be it, but if you are pushing it for time, get BACK before the next spear. Or else you will die up there! More about ballistas below.
> 
> **Ballista** - Near the fight are several barrels with ballista parts in. There are also 2x ballistas in the room, either side of the fight. Players during the fight will need to collect parts in order to FIX the ballistas to fire ONE arrow and then go and get more parts to repair again. This is something people must be familiar with for the following mechanics.
> 
> NOTE: You can pick up parts at the beginning or at any time, and hold on to them until you are ready to run to the ballista and use them. So you can ple-plan this. The way to visually know if you have ballista parts with you is that you/or others will be wearing a BIG back pack! Yes many people can do this at once.
> 
> **Conjurers** - During the fight every 45 seconds, a Conjurer will appear on the ship in the sea and channel a portal! This portal will open up next to the group and 3 adds will come through. While these adds do need to be killed, the portal can be utilized by one player and they can jump through it to appear on the boat WITH the conjurer. This player will be required to SOLO kill the add while maintaining their own survivability. However, if players want to help them, they can SHOOT the conjurer from the ballistas! The conjurer will take 2 ballista shots to kill OR one shot and some damage from the individual, or simply, just the solo yolo hero. Send your most capable player onto that boat and your problems are solved.
> 
> During this however, the adds on the land will need to be dealt with. It is incredibly important that you recognize the enemy types and their mechanics. TWO archers above all will be in the group and if they dodge roll backwards they will start to channel. INTERRUPT them as soon as possible as your priority mechanic in order to prevent them from finishing this channel. If not, they will enrage!
> 
> Also be sure to interrupt the Apothecaries because they will heal the boss. Also watch your feet as they cast fire on the ground.
> 
> The conjurers will continue to spawn with the adds and the portal until 50% health of the main boss every 45 seconds.
> 
> **Shamans** - Remember the shaman from the first boss hard mode? Well maybe you did the non hardmode...if so this will be new to you. Pay close attention because this is the game changer!
> 
> Under 50% there are NO more Conjurers, No more add portals. Instead there will be shamans that spawn on the boat. A total of x3. These will channel into the air and release meteors at members of the group. If a meteor is on you you MUST block, or you will be stunned/knockedown/killed. More shams mean MORE meteors...
> 
> So you guessed it, THIS is where the ballista really comes into play. Both ballistas need to be repaired, fire, repaired fire, over and over and over in order to make sure these are always dead. Each shaman will take ONE shot each but they spawn every 45 seconds and you do not want to get overwhelmed by them. If the ballistas are dealt with efficiently, the meteor mechanic will NEVER happen. If not, you will stagger into a barrage of fireballs and all die.
> 
> TIP: Remember that the shock spear/harpoon will be fired every 45 seconds as well as the shamans now spawning every 45 seconds. So while pressure does need to be applied to them, you must also be sure not to yolo off up the cliff when the harpoon is coming. Let it land in the group, THEN run. Remember furthest away is the target. Don't let that be you!
> 
> **Lightning Twins** - At 50% and under the boss will periodically spawn a Lightning twin of himself next to him. He will tether himself to whoever has aggro of the boss, so make sure 100% that the tank has aggro on the boss, else a player in the group is getting aggro and you CANNOT taunt these! While they are alive they do have basic attacks and cause a minor inconvenience however during the fight if they do not die, others will spawn over and over. This can be done regardless of how many you have spawn but if you are struggling, make it easy on yourself and just kill them. If you are constantly killing these you will still SLOWLY kill the boss anyway and there is no dps check for him personally, you can take as long as you like so long as you are maintaining focus on the other surrounding mechanics.
> 
> The one major issue these Lightning twins cause on the group is that it has ONE interruptable mechanic. If he channels, you MUST bash/interrupt him, else he will cast an ice/water wave across the floor in the direction he is facing, causing damage and knocking down those hit. AOE interrupt abilities are great in this situation especially if you end up with more than one of them but this ONE mechanic is simple, and deadly. Consistently fail to interrupt? expect to fail! Bring your basic mechanics to this fight! Always interrupt!
> 
> From here nothing in the fight changes. So keep doing what you are doing!
> 
> **HARDMODE** - There are some small differences to hardmode. Firstly the boss of course has more health but there are different adds to cover too.
> 
> When the adds come through the portal you will ALSO get Bulwarks. These much like the others in the trash pulls follow a simple mechanic. They carry a protection shield. They themselves are not protected but ANYTHING inside of the shield will NOT take damage until the shield is done. So be sure to heavily focus the bulwark as your main target. Others can STILL be interrupted so don't skip that part of the mechanics but these must die first, OR be taken out of the group while you kill the others. Since you are on a timer however with them spawning every 45 seconds, it makes sense to get rid of them.
> 
> Also one more thing to note during the entire fight lightning will strike random players in the group directly with a tiny aoe attached. DON'T STACK too tight!
