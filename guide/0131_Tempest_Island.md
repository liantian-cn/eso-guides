## 风暴岛





### 族长索诺里娅

> Sonolia the Matriarch


**族长索诺里娅**

这个Boss很简单，但是拉怪可能有些棘手。这是那些鲁莽的人反复死亡的地方。确保坦克优先去拉怪，并尽可能多地拉住怪物以减轻团队的压力。这个Boss可以有两种方式来打。你可以把入口处的小组怪物拉到远离Boss的地方，不要引起Boss的注意（这样很简单）或者你可以将所有的怪物都聚集到Boss身边。团队的经验会决定你选择哪种方式。当然，最安全的方法是耐心一点。

* **重击** :  这是大多数BOSS非常简单而常见的机制。这是一次典型的重击，必须格挡，否则你会被击倒。无论你是坦克还是其他职业，如果BOSS的攻击瞄准到你，你必须格挡它。

* **尖叫** :  这是boss前方的锥形AOE攻击。她会朝着仇恨目标（希望是坦克）的方向尖叫。坦克应该将她转向远离团队，并确保她一直停留在原地。尖叫攻击可以被格挡，但她会使人失去方向感，如果受影响，必须解除。如果她瞄准dps/治疗，则他们也可以格挡主要伤害，但我强烈建议只是简单地移出锥形区域，以免受到攻击。这可能对脆弱的人造成很大的打击，因此应尽可能避免。

整个团队应该站在首领身后，坦克站在首领前方，以使战斗尽可能简单。





### 风暴召唤者瓦拉兰

> Valaran Stormcaller


**瓦拉兰风暴召唤者**

这个首领的血量很低，但由于其中一个技能的巨大效果，人们很容易惊慌失措。不要惊慌。很容易避开，看起来并不像那么具有攻击性。坦克应该尽可能让首领保持稳定，并面对着其他团队成员的背面，团队则应该站在首领后面，准备从特定机制中移动。

* **电光飞溅** :  有时候boss会释放一种闪电技能，向玩家和附近的盟友投射天空中的闪电。这种技能只会持续3-4秒，并在这段时间内提高其抵抗力。这是一种非常弱的攻击，只要有治疗支持，对团队来说不会是问题。不要逃跑...放松并集中精力打战斗。

* **电光化身** :  这个Boss会以电光的形式投射出一个自身的倒影。坦克可以嘲讽它，并应该与Boss一起控制。不要在房间里四处乱跑，因为这样会使其难以控制。一旦坦克控制了它，你可以安全地集中火力攻击Boss，同时倒影会因为AOE伤害而死亡。倒影的生命值很低，因此如果受到控制，不会造成太多问题。

* **攻略
眩晕** :  确保 BOSS 被嘲讽之后它有可能仍会瞄准其他玩家，所以请注意你的生命值。偶尔，它会随机眩晕一个玩家，因此一定要在战斗中保持不低于一定生命值，否则如果在眩晕时遭受伤害，就会导致问题。您可以从眩晕状态中解脱出来，如果这种情况发生在您身上，那么需要做出一些快速的反应。

* **电光领域** :  这个范围极大的AOE技能会在整个战斗中来回移动。你需要做的就是在它来到你面前时躲避开来，让它通过。在房间里到处乱跑会成为一个巨大的问题。疯狂的行为意味着会受到更多的伤害，而治疗师则难以跟上节奏。只需要移动到一边并回到原位即可。整个战斗过程中都会有这个技能，如果你被击中，就会受到真正的伤害。坦克应该没问题，但是DPS和治疗师需要小心。





### 发言人雅罗拉瑟

> Yalorasse the Speaker


**发言人雅罗拉瑟**

这个首领比较简单，但如果你不知道要做什么可能会有点慌乱。房间里有很多小怪需要处理，所以最好让坦克把它们堆在首领脚下，并尽可能稳定地控制住首领，将首领背向团队。在房间里乱跑会导致问题，所以要放松心态，找到自己的位置。特别要注意远程小怪，尤其是治疗师和弓箭手，需要时刻打断他们的技能。

* **重击** :  这是一个简单的重击。坦克应该已经吸引了 BOSS 的注意力，所以当然应该由坦克来格挡这个攻击，但是如果一个 DPS 或治疗被攻击，则只要确保你格挡这个攻击，你就不会有问题。如果没有格挡，则你会被击飞到房间的另一边。

* **旋风** :  这个BOSS可以像旋风/钢铁飓风技能一样在小范围AOE中旋转，这是大多数双持近战类型的典型特点。坦克可以应对这种攻击，但作为DPS和治疗，只需要远离它约5米左右，就不会受到攻击。但如果你靠得太近来不及躲避，只需格挡即可减轻大部分伤害。不要逃跑，只需格挡。

* **电光飞溅** :  首领会定期在地面上施放一个小型的闪电范围攻击，通常是朝向拥有仇恨值的人的方向（应该是坦克，但如果不是请不要惊慌）。你只需要简单地走出范围并找到另一个安全的位置站立即可。伤害并不太高，但你肯定不想在里面停留太久。





### 暴风拳

> Stormfist


STORMFIST（风暴拳）攻略： 

这个BOSS非常强大，他的攻击拥有极高的伤害，并且能够同时影响多个玩家。在战斗中，BOSS会不断地召唤出风暴元素，同时还会发送电光飞溅等攻击技能。 

如果你被电光飞溅攻击到，不要着急立即使用恢复药剂，因为BOSS还会继续使用其他技能攻击你。而如果你被风暴元素包围，可以试着离开它们的范围，或者寻求队友的帮助一起进行攻击。 

在打败风暴拳之后，你还需要面对族长索诺里娅和风暴首领内迪尔，他们的攻击同样非常强大。对付索诺里娅时，要注意躲避她的闪电攻击，并且使用强力的DOT伤害技能。而打败内迪尔需要利用好地形，尽可能避免被他的强力风暴攻击摧毁。 

最后进入BOSS战时，你会面对风暴召唤者瓦拉兰。他会不断向你的位置召唤出风暴，你需要在战斗中随时保持注意，避免被风暴攻击到。同时，BOSS还会使用一些AOE技能，试着躲闪或者使用物理护盾来有效减少伤害。

这个首领是这个地下城中可能最有趣的战斗之一。他的生命值不算太高，但其中一个机制会让你感到有点好笑，如果你“意外”被抓住的话（我有罪，如果我知道它不会杀死我，有时我会有意地站在里面开心玩…但在你有很高的抗性之前，我不建议这样做！）。

坦克应该把这个首领放在中心并将其转向团队以外。其他人应该站在首领后方，不要乱跑。

* **巨拳** :  首领偶尔会猛击地面，然后会从地面生成一个巨大的手，握成拳头，将任何在其中的人压碎。这个AOE范围相当小，应该很容易避开。这将会使目标昏迷，但是坦克可以格挡并/或解除束缚。

* **爪牙** : Boss将定期产生比他自己小的版本。他们跑得相当快，因此坦克需要对它们进行快速抓取，如果可能的话，不要移动Boss。如果它们作为DPS或治疗追击你，请不要惊慌，它们的伤害不高，且它们的伤害可以被格挡。因此，如果它们在你身上，请进行阻挡一段时间，直到坦克控制它们，一切就都没问题了。它们很容易因AOE伤害而死亡，所以不要逃跑。

* **跺脚** :  在我看来，这是游戏中最有趣的机制之一。Boss会抬起脚， 然后出现一个迅速蔓延的AOE效果。现在这非常重要。如果你对这个战斗不熟悉，游戏新手和/或具有低cps / 抗性......要尽可能快地远离它，然后在它消失后再回来。协调是关键，如果你被抓住，你会承受大量伤害。这将把你扔到空中！并使你昏迷。

但是说实话，如果你的抗性很高或者有大约300+合适的cp点分布在抗性上，你就能够存活下来，并且被抛向天空的感觉很刺激！注意：你没有在这里看到这些！

* **激怒** :  当boss的血量低于25%时，它会激怒。它会举起双手，每秒钟不断释放带有电击伤害的范围攻击，造成大量伤害！不要试图逃跑，逃跑无济于事。坦克应该从中吸收debuff并试图保护小组，治疗师应该全力治疗并保持人员的生命值，DPS需要保持专注，坚定站好脚，尽可能产生持续的伤害来杀死它。如果人们停止攻击或停止治疗并四处乱跑，那么你们都会死亡。关键词在于“专注”。





### 欧曼尼队长

> Commodore Ohmanil


无法翻译。该段文字中包含未知语言或未标明的专有名词。

这个BOSS实际上很简单，只有几个机制，但是有非常多的小怪。他在人群中很难被发现，因此一定要注意。坦克需要尽快抓住他，但同时要试图将尽可能多的小怪聚集在他身上，这样他们就可以在小队的AOE中死亡。DPS和治疗者应该密切留意对于法师和弓箭手等的远程打断。简化这个战斗的方法是先跑进去抓一些小怪，并用AOE焚烧它们，而老板则会过来攻击你。但这取决于你的团队。个人建议在房间前建立垃圾的终极状况，以便可以快速而有力地打击。

* **重击** :  首领会发动致命的重击，如果你没能避开就会击倒并造成大量伤害，所以一定要格挡。这个重击将会针对嘲讽目标（一般是坦克），但如果击中了DPS或治疗，一定要格挡。不要惊慌，这个房间非常繁忙，很容易错过。找到自己的位置，放松心态。不要四处乱跑，这样可以更容易观察情况。

* **游戏攻略翻译如下
飘浮术** :  在战斗中，Boss 会将一名组员悬浮在空中约 5 秒钟，但可以打破此状态。如果你是受害者，你可以打破状态。如果你不是受害者，你可以打断 Boss 并解救你的队友！





### 风暴首领内迪尔

> Stormreeve Neidir


** 风暴首领内迪尔 **

这个PUGs（随机队伍）的首领非常可怕！你必须注意并且必须协调。你需要时刻注意你自己的站立位置和首领的手。坦克当然应该一直嘲讽，但她会打击团队成员。每个人应该有自己的空间。不要把自己的位置与别人堆叠在一起，否则，当首领瞄准您时，你将不知道是否是自己被瞄准，还是其他人（反之亦然），这非常难以应对即将到来的伤害。

站在一个明显能够让你们四个人看到她是否直接攻击你或其他人的队形中。不要惊慌并且始终靠近她，除非机制阻止，这是关键...除非出现某种特定机制（下面会解释），你必须保持靠近！

注：在这个首领房间里四处乱跑必死。

* **轻攻击** :  BOSS会在任何时候攻击她想攻击的人，这就是为什么你们需要找到自己的位置，以确保知道她瞄准的是谁。聚集在一起会让这个过程变得不可预测。她会朝着她选择的目标发射冻结的轻攻击，通常会连续发射三次。这些攻击非常疼痛！如果你是被攻击的目标人物，要使用护盾和格挡（如果是魔法攻击），或是使用格挡/闪避（如果是体力攻击），只要你有足够的体力来做到这一点。治疗师应该关注目标，保持他们的生命值，否则两次连续的攻击没有治疗会使你瞬间死亡。如果你的cp /抗性很低而且没有防御，你几乎是死定了。虽然BOSS可能会被嘲讽，但她会攻击任何她想攻击的目标。

* **电光飞溅** :  当首领举起手时会召唤一次电光飞溅。这基本上就是一个法师的愤怒。她会看着她即将攻击的目标，如果攻击的目标是你，你必须格挡（如果可能的话，使用一个伤害盾牌如果你也是魔法系的）。这会造成可怕的伤害，如果你不格挡，这几乎可以消灭任何人，除了坦克。此外，如果你此时不是满血状态，它可以像法师的愤怒一样进行斩杀。要小心。记住，位置至关重要，你需要知道她瞄准的目标是谁。

* **BURST** :  这个超大范围攻击不仅对非坦克职业是一击必杀，而且如果你是那种“围着房间跑”的或者“我想我能挺过去的”类型的人，那么掌握起来也非常困难。不要低估这个机制，因为它直接和下一个机制有关。当首领开始施法时，将会在她脚下散发出一个巨大的范围攻击。尽快离开这个范围并且尽量不要跑得比这个范围的边缘更远。一旦攻击达到巅峰，它就会爆发，除了肉盾以外的任何人都会死亡！在攻击结束后，你必须毫不犹豫地立即回到之前的位置（尽可能靠近首领的队形）！

* **超人拳击** :  不，技能并不叫做“超人拳击”，但这个说法确实恰当。你会注意到我说一直保持和BOSS的距离，除了在扩散AOE攻击之外......然后我又说尽快回到BOSS身边！这是因为如果你离BOSS太远，她会对距离最远的人使用超人拳，一击必杀！

永远不要远离BOSS。 之前的机制与基于此机制运作的AOE意味着......快速出去然后再快速返回。

* **长风机制** :  这是一个非常重要的机制，你必须时刻注意它的变化。房间里会有风/云/烟雾（你可以随意称呼），它们会不断移动。战斗时间越长，这些物品就会刷新得越多，而且它们很难控制。如果你被它们击中，你将被震慑一秒钟，同时还会受到伤害，因此你必须绕开它们。其中一些会对玩家造成电击，造成伤害并打断玩家的技能的施放。

以下是攻略的翻译：

这里有一个问题。如果boss使用她的大范围AOE机制，而你躲开它（甚至在回避时），而你碰到了一个风云，它将会使你晕眩并且将你推回到AOE内，这意味着你已经死了。如果在她开始使用AOE时你被风云击中，你就没有时间逃脱并且你死了。如果你在逃离AOE时被其中一枚风云击中，你将被晕眩并且距离她太远太久，这将意味着她会对你使用超人击打，这意味着你已经死了。最后如果你在她的轻攻击和/或她的电光飞溅期间被击中，你将受到足够的伤害，使下一个即将到来的攻击一击必杀你...这意味着（你猜对了）你已经死了！

云层的攻击伤害并不大，但需要尽可能地避免，因为它们会对你的表现和完成战斗的能力造成影响。因此，每当你需要避免机制时，请注意周围的情况，小心谨慎。不要惊慌，注意脚下。另外，专心观察机制和移动路径，以便更好地规避攻击。

概述：靠近攻击，如果她以你为目标则格挡，避开范围攻击，立即重新进攻...避免受到风的影响，千万不要在房间里乱跑。祝好运！

> This boss is very simple but the pull can be tricky to manage. This is where yoloers die on repeat. Be sure that the tank goes first and grabs as many adds as possible to take the pressure off the group. The boss can be fought in two ways. You can pull the adds in the entrance to the room separately in a small group away from the boss without getting her attention (which makes things pretty simple) or you can stack everything on the boss. The experience of the group would determine which one you are able to do. Safest of course is take your time.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - This is a very simple and common mechanic from most bosses. A typical heavy attack which must be blocked or you will be knocked down. Whether you are a Tank or not, if this is aimed at you...you MUST block it.
> 
> **Scream** - This is a cone shaped AOE in front of the boss. She will scream in the direction of the person with agro (hopefully the tank). The tank should turn her away from the group and be sure she is always staying still. The scream damage can be blocked but she does disorientate so if you are affected you must break free. If she is aiming at the dps /healer they CAN also block the main force of the damage but i would highly recommend simpley moving out of the cone so you don't get hit by it. This can hit very hard to a squishy and should be avoided as much as possible.
> 
> The group should be behind the boss and the tank in front of the boss to make this as simple as possible.

> 
> This boss is quite squishy but it is very easy for people to panic because of the sheer size of one of the effects which happen during the fight. do NOT panic. it is very easy to avoid and isn't anywhere near as aggressive as it looks. The tank should hold the boss as still as possible facing away from the rest of the group and the group should stand behind the boss ready to move from certain mechanics.
> 
> **Lightning strike** - Occasionally the boss will cast a lightning ability that strikes the player and nearby allies with fork lightening from the sky. This only lasts about 3-4 seconds and increases his resists at the time too. This is a very weak attack so as long as heals are coming i, won't be a problem to the group. Don't run away...relax and keep focus on the fight.
> 
> **Lightning Avatar** - The boss will cast a reflection of himself in a lightning form. This can be taunted by the tank and should be held onto with the boss. Do not run around the room with it because it will make it really difficult to control if you do. Once the tank has control of it you should be safe to focus the boss while the reflection dies to AOE damage. The reflection has very low health so if controlled wont cause much of a problem.
> 
> **Stun** - Even with a taunt on the boss he can still sometimes aim at other players so be aware of your health. Occasionally he will randomly stun a player so be sure not to drop too low health while fighting else this can cause a problem if damage is hitting you while stunned. You can break free from this so some quick thinking is required if this happens to you.
> 
> **Lightning Field** - This ENORMOUS AOE will move back and forth throughout the whole fight. All you have to do is move out of the way of it when it comes to you and let it pass. Running around the room will become a massive problem. Frantic behavior will mean more damage will be taken and it is heard for the healer to keep up. Simply move to one side and get back to where you were again. This happens throughout the whole fight and if you get caught it will REALLY hurt. A tank should be fine but dps and healers need to be careful.

> This boss is simple but can a bit of a panic to start with if you do not know what to expect. There are a fair amount of adds in the room which need to be dealt with so if possibly the tank should stack them on the bosses feet and hold the boss as still as possible turning it AWAY from the group. Running around the room will cause problems so relax and find your feet. Keep an eye out for ranged adds especially the healer and the archer as they need to be interrupted from time to time.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - This is a simple heavy attack. The tank SHOULD have agro anyway so of course this should be blocked by the tank however... IF a dps or a healer ends up being targeted, so long as you make sure you block this attack you will be fine. If not you will fly across the room.
> 
> **Whirlwind** - Typical of most dual wield melee types this boss can spin the same as the whirlwind/steel tornado ability in a small AOE. The tank will be fine with this but as dps and healers you just need to be out of range of it. so about 5meters away or so and this wont hit you. But if you are up close and it is too late to move, simply block and you will mitigate the majority of the damage. Don't run just block.
> 
> **Lightning Splash** - The boss will periodically cast a small AOE of lightning on the floor, usually in the direction of whoever has agro (should be the tank but don't panic if it is not). All you need to do is simply walk out of it and find another safe position to stand in. The damage isn't too high but you certainly don't want to stand in it too long.

> This boss is quite possibly the most fun encounter in this dungeon. He doesn't have too much health but one of the mechanics is a bit of a laugh if you 'accidentally' get caught (guilty, if i know it won't kill me i sometimes stand in it on purpose for fun..but i wouldn't recommend it until you have high resists!
> 
> The tank should position this boss in  the center and turn it away from the group and the rest of the group should stay behind the boss and NOT run around.
> 
> **Fist** - The boss will occasionally punch the ground and then a LARGE grabbing hand will spawn out of the ground into a fist and crush whoever is inside of it. The AOE of this is quite small and should be easy to step out of and avoid. This will stun but the tank can block it and/or break free if caught.
> 
> **Minions** - Periodically the boss will spawn smaller versions of himself. They do run quite fast so the tank needs to be on the ball with these  and grab them fast without moving the boss if possible. If they chase you as a dps or healer don't panic, they do not hurt much and the damage they throw can be blocked. So if they are on you, block for a bit until the tank has control and all should be fine. They die fast to AOE damage so do NOT run away.
> 
> **Stomp!!** - One of the most fun mechanics in the game in my opinion. The boss will raise his foot and a rapid spreading AOE will appear. Now this is very important. IF you are unfamiliar with the fight, new to the game and/or have low cps/resist..get out of this as fast as possible and then get back in again when it is gone. Co-ordination is key and if you get caught you will take a LOT of damage. This will throw you into the AIR! and stun you as well.
> 
> BUT if i am honest, if you have high resists or around 300+ cps with well placed resist cps, you can survive it and it is a lot of fun to be flung up into the sky! note: you didn't read that here!
> 
> **Enrage** - The boss enrages under 25% health. He will raise his hands and constantly burst in AOE with lightning damage every second causing massive damage! Don't try to run it won't save you. The tank should apply debuff from the taught and try to protect the group, the healer should go to town on the heals and keep people up, and the dps need to stay focused, plant their feet and do as much sustained damage as possible to kill it. IF people stop damage and if people stop healing and run around the room, you will all die. key word here...'FOCUS'.

> This boss is actually pretty simple with only a couple of mechanics but there are SO many adds. He is hard to spot in a crowd too so make sure you pay attention here. The tank needs to grab him as soon as possible but at the same time try to stack as many adds on him as possible so THEY can die in AOE from the group. The dps and healers should keep their eyes peeled for ranged interrupts for casters and archers etc. A simpler way to sort out this fight is to run in and grab some adds first off and burn them down with aoe while the boss comes to YOU. But that depends on your group. I personally would recommend building up ultimate on the trash before this room so that you can hit hard and fast.
> 
> **Heavy attack** - The boss will fire off a nasty heavy attack that will knock down and do a LOT of damage if you miss it so be sure to block this. This will be aimed at who ever has agro (should be the tank) but if it hits a dps or healer, make sure you are blocking. Do not panic, this room is VERY busy and those are easy to miss. Find your feet, and relax. The less running around you do the easier it is to see what is going on.
> 
> **Levitate**  - During the fight the boss will suspend a member of the group in mid air for around 5 seconds at most. This can be broken however. If you are the victim you can break free. And if you are not the victim you can bash/interrupt the boss and set your group member FREE!

> This boss for PUGs (pick up groups) is a NIGHTMARE! You must pay attention and you MUST co-ordinate. It is key that you watch your feet and her hands at all times! The tank should be taunting all the time of course but she WILL hit group members when she feels like it. Everyone should have their OWN space. Do not stack on each others feet else when she aims at YOU, you wont know that it is you and could be someone else instead (or vica versa) and it is incredibly difficult to react to the incoming damage.
> 
> Stand in a formation which clearly allows all 4 of you to have enough room to see if she is directly attacking you or someone else. Do not panic and stay close to her at all times unless mechanics prevent it, this is key...unless a certain mechanic happens (explained below) you MUST stay close!
> 
> Note: running around the room on this boss is certain death.
> 
> **Light Attacks** - The boss will hit who she likes when she likes, this is why you all find your own positions to make sure you know WHO she is aiming at. Stacking up will make this impossible to tell. She will fire off frost light attacks at her chosen target, usually x3 in a row. These HURT! If you are the target, shield and block (if magicka) or block/dodge roll if you are stamina and you can afford the stamina to do so. The healer should focus the target and keep them up as 2 of these in a row without a heal WILL kill you. If you are low cp/resists and you do not block...you are pretty much dead. Although the boss maybe taunted she will do this to whoever she likes.
> 
> **Lightning Strike** - When the boss raises her hand she will call down a lightning strike. Pretty much a mages wrath. She will LOOK at the target she is going to hit, if this is you, you MUST block (with a damage shield if you are magicka as well if possible) This deals ridiculous damage and if you are not blocking this can pretty much wipe out anyone but a tank. Also if you are not full health at the time, it can act exactly like mages wrath and execute you in one hit. BE careful. Remember position is key you NEED to know who she is aiming at.
> 
> **BURST!** - This MASSIVE AOE is not only a one shot to anyone that isn't a tank but incredibly difficult to master if you are one of those 'run around the room' types or one of those 'i think i can make it ' types. Do NOT underestimate this mechanic because it ties in directly with the next one. She will start casting and a huge AOE will spread from under her feet. Get out of this as fast as possible and try to not run further than the very edge of the AOE. Once this reaches it's peek it will burst and unless you are a meaty tank, ANYONE caught inside it is dead! As soon as this is over you MUST get straight back into your previous position (formation around the boss close as possible) without hesitation!
> 
> **Superman Punch!** - No the ability is not called a 'superman punch' but it is appropriate. You will notice that i say stay near the boss at all times apart from the spreading AOE...then i note get back in ASAP! This is because if you are too far away from the boss, she will superman punch the person furthest a way and kill them in ONE SHOT!
> 
> Never stay away from the boss. The previous mechanic with the AOE based on THIS mechanic means..get out and get back in again FAST
> 
> **Wind** - This is a VERY important mechanic and you must have your eyes all over the place to keep track of it. There are winds/clouds/smoke whatever you want to call them, moving around the room. The longer the fight the more of these spawn and they are REALLY difficult to manage. If you get hit by them they will knock you back staggering you for a second and also deal damage. So you have to move around them.
> 
> Here is where it becomes a problem. IF the boss is doing her burst AOE mechanic and you move out of it (even in a dodge roll) and you catch a wind cloud, it will stagger you and push you back IN to the AOE. Meaning you are dead. If you get hit by the wind as she is starting her AOE you wont have time to get out and you are dead. IF you get hit by one while you escape the AOE you will be staggered and too far from her for too long and she will superman punch you meaning you are dead. And finally if you get hit by these during her light attack and/or her lightning splash you will take enough damage to make the next incoming attack one shot you...meaning (you guessed it) you are dead!
> 
> The damage from the clouds are not huge but these need to be avoided at all costs because they really mess with your performance and ability to complete the fight. So whenever you have to avoid a mechanic, LOOK around you and be careful. Don't panic and watch your feet.
> 
> Recap: Stay close, block if she focuses you, get out of the AOE, get straight back IN again...avoid the wind, and for goodness sake do NOT run around the room panicking. GOOD LUCK!
