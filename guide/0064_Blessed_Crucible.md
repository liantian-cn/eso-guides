### 聪明的格朗特

> Grunt The Clever


**聪明的格朗特**

这个首领非常简单，拥有一些非常明显的机制。正如你所想象的那样，由于它是一个非常大的目标，它的攻击确实相当强力，但它也非常缓慢，因此很容易避免攻击。

然而，为了开始战斗，你需要先与他进行交谈，而不是传统的“冲进去打东西”的方式。

在与所有首领战斗时，坦克应确保将首领背对团队，团队应始终待在目标背后，以防止被牙齿攻击！

* **猛击攻击** :  时不时地，首领会使用一个巨大的挥击攻击面前的范围。如果你被击中了，你会被抛到空中很远的地方，飞出你所在的平台。你所需要做的就是简单地躲闪或者走出这个范围，你就不会受伤。

* **恐惧** :  这就是提示文本上所说的。老板偶尔会对整个队伍咆哮，使所有成员在3-4秒内向老板随机方向逃跑。在这个阶段，你所需要做的就是解除束缚。只要你在大部分战斗中保持耐力资源，你就可以（或应该能够）在被恐吓时立即解除束缚。但是要小心，因为解除束缚后，老板可能会立即使用猛击攻击来打击奔跑中的目标。





### 斯纳格·格罗马舒尔

> Snagg Gro-Mashul


该攻略的标题为 "猛兽团队"，其中 "THE PACK" 表示猛兽群体的意思。

这个BOSS是一个竞技场类型的场景，在这里你需要对抗多波的小敌人，有近战和远程攻击的。团队应该在敌人的波浪中央集中，坦克应该尽可能地用链式技能把远程敌人拉过来，以便团队能够通过AOE伤害快速消灭它们。一旦所有的小兵都被消灭了，4个BOSS会跳进房间。坦克应该将所有的四个BOSS聚集在一起并保持不动，尽量不要让它们中的任何一个面对着团队。

注意：这些首领可以被连锁、眩晕、定身、控制，并且在战斗中会出现生命药水在地上，如果需要的话你可以捡起来。

* **斯纳格·格罗玛什尔** :  这个BOSS会通过他的双手武器释放旋风AOE效果，但是这个效果范围很小，很容易通过迈出它的范围来避免。他还会使用升天击的重型攻击，所以一定要格挡。

* **Nusana** :  首领有时会施放一道火焰，沿着地面扫过，需要注意避开，只需向一侧移动，让它经过即可，但是如果被击中，会非常痛苦。请保持警惕。

* **Dynus Aralas** :  这个首领会释放火和冰能力，包括一些控制技能，因此请确保密切留意这个首领，以便能够打断治疗和伤害吟唱技能。

* **Kayd at** : Sal** - 这个首领就像传统的潜行者类型，攻击速度快，可以轻易地消灭一个DPS。最重要的是，必须集中攻击这个首领，而你的坦克绝不能放弃对它的嘲讽。它非常狡猾。如果你是一个DPS，而这个家伙针对你，要靠近坦克，这样坦克就能重新获得敌人的仇恨，一定要阻挡来袭的攻击。

所有的首领在剩余30%的生命时会变成狼人，拥有乱舞、重击和猛爪袭击的击退能力。





### 无面者特兰雅

> Teranya The Faceless


** 无面者特兰雅 **

这个Boss很简单，但攻击非常强。并且在开始时需要处理2只愤怒的狼。如果坦克将Boss背对着队伍摆放并压制两只狼，当Boss慢慢受到伤害时，它们应该被群攻击倒下。尽可能让Boss保持原地。

* **重击** :  就像名字所说的那样。重击可以被格挡，造成伤害的对象是坦克或拥有仇恨的人。无论你扮演的角色是什么，如果你被命中了，一定要格挡。如果不格挡，你会被击倒并受到巨大的伤害。

* **Whirlwind** :  基本上是一种钢铁旋风攻击，BOSS会旋转，任何在其周围小范围AOE内的人物都会受到物理伤害。这很容易避免，当你看到旋转即将来临时，后退几步，当攻击结束时再向前迈步。

* **爆裂妖灵** :  整场战斗中会出现妖灵并朝着队伍奔跑，当它们到达目标时就会爆炸！这对于输出职业非常危险，需要妥善处理。AOE伤害有时足以在它们变成问题之前就将它们击杀，但如果不能如此，坦克也可以固定它们在它们试图逃跑时。

最安全的管理方式首先是确保dps和治疗者在boss后面但不要太靠近（除非是近战构建），这样Banekins有更长的跑路时间并且可能在到达你之前死亡。然而，如果它们真的到达了你，只需格挡和/或释放伤害护盾，你就没问题了。





### Blessed Crucible的翻译为神圣熔炉。

> INCINERATION BEETLES


THE STINGER, INCINERATION BEETLES & THE TROLL KING （尾针蝎、烈焰甲虫和巨魔王）

这个BOSS其实是三个波，一个是与4只烈焰甲虫的战斗，下一个是刺虫，最后是巨魔王。你的坦克需要密切关注这些战斗，并确保任何被嘲讽的目标都面朝远离团队的方向。 DPS和治疗需要集中注意力，因为在房间里四处奔跑会致命。

* **焚化甲虫** :  4只恶心的火焰甲虫。坦克应该尽可能持续地控制它们。尽可能同时对这四只甲虫造成AOE伤害，以快速而平均地杀死它们。整场战斗中这些甲虫特别是在低血量时会放出恶心的脉动火焰AOE（会烧很多）并在地上放置AOE（更多的火焰），站在里面会很糟糕！不要站在里面，你的治疗师需要非常注意接下来的伤害，如果队员们被困住了。这些甲虫血量很低，但是它们能够消灭队伍。请小心。

* **刺蜂** :  这个首领非常简单。坦克应该将其面向团队外侧，同时防御任何重击。当首领将其刺插入地面时，一个玩家会被定为目标，毒液会从他们下方射出以击杀他们，只需远离这个区域，然后继续完成任务即可。不要在房间里奔跑，只需稍微移动并继续操作即可。

* **巨魔之王** :  这个家伙巨大，如果你能听懂他，他其实有点像只小狗。但是，如果你惊慌失措地在房间里乱跑，你就会被击败。提示...要保持靠近他！

* **跳跃** :  这个机制很简单，如果你离BOSS太远，他会跳到你头上。保持靠近。

**猛击**– 首领会用力砸地，产生大面积AOE效果，很容易被察觉。简单的格挡或躲避即可，但一定要尽快回到原位置，以防他跳到远程目标。





### 索兰队长

> Captain Thoran


** 索兰队长 **

这个首领很小而且易碾，但如果不快速处理可能会造成很多伤害。房间里有很多小兵，坦克应该尽可能将它们与首领聚集在一起。

* **火焰符文** :  这个首领会把火焰符文扔在地上，会造成高额的伤害，一定要避免站在上面。

* **云雾** :  BOSS会在房间内随机释放紫色云雾，请一定要躲避它们，不要站在里面，否则会对脆弱的玩家造成高伤害。

* **Atronach** :  血量较多的首领将会召唤一个火焰元素，并为首领提供一个伤害护盾。

只要你击败火焰元素，boss的伤害护盾就会消失。这对接下来的boss战非常重要。请记住，当你击败火焰元素时，它们会爆炸，所以不要站在它们死亡的位置上。





### 熔岩女王

> The Lava Queen


**熔岩女王**

这是个棘手的游戏！有很多事情在发生，你所见到的几乎都会杀了你，熔岩致命，火焰致命，地板上的熔岩之类的都很危险。那些小小的熔岩池不是为了好玩或者景观的一部分，它们是高伤害区域，你不应该站在里面。所以要注意你的脚下！

坦克应该尽量将Boss置于中央，而不要站在熔岩上，并准备好承受巨大的痛苦。千万不要放掉Boss！

对于所有的组队成员来说，你们必须找到自己的位置并集中注意力。不要在房间里到处跳舞，否则你们会死亡而且很难恢复。

* **Atronachs（魔像）** :  就像上一个BOSS一样，魔像会生成。在这场战斗中，当她的健康值越低，就会生成越多的魔像。它们会对她附上一束光束，并使她对一切伤害免疫，直到魔像死亡。你必须集中攻击这些魔像，但一定要遵循机制，因为这些机制可能与其他阶段重合。

* **重击** :  这个首领有一个非常强力的重击攻击！如果你格挡住了它，你几乎不会受到伤害（连一个DPS也能存活下来），但是如果你没有及时格挡它，你会被击飞很远，而她会在你倒地时继续攻击。这个重击也有延迟的动画，所以一定要在看到她准备攻击时即可开始格挡，因为它将在动画完成之前就打中你。

* **爆发** :  战斗期间岩浆池将随机爆发并向房间内发射火焰，注意脚下并避免接触它们。它们的范围很小，但造成的伤害非常大！

* **炎之攻击** :  这位首领会随机对团队进行炎属性的轻攻击，通常针对距离最远的目标。因此，在看到这种情况时，请时刻保持护盾或防御状态。

* **车轮** :  从鸟瞰角度来看，这看起来像车轮的辐条。她会把剑插进地面，从她到区域边缘喷发出数条快速移动的火线。这些线条的方向是随机的，但会持续不停地发射，直到她站起来为止。

这个技巧就在于距离！保持距离会导致反应时间不够。一旦你看到她向地面刺，就要向后移动并保持尽可能远的安全距离，观察地面上的火焰，如果它对准了你，只需左右移动以避免它。

一旦这个阶段结束，重新回到内部。被这个攻击击中将会秒杀一个DPS或治疗，所以保持分散，躲避攻击，再回到内部……简单有效，但如果做错了，会带来毁灭性影响。

摆脱吸血鬼不会拯救你...这个技能会秒杀除了坦克以外的所有人，即使大多数坦克也会死亡，无论有没有成为吸血鬼。注意脚下！

祝你好运！

> Grunt The Clever

> 
> ** GRUNT THE CLEVER **
> 
> This boss is a very simple one with some very obvious mechanics, as you would imagine he does hit fairly hard since he is a very large target, but he is also very sluggish so simple to avoid hits.
> 
> To initiate the fight however instead of the traditional 'run in and smack stuff' you do have to converse with him for the fight to start.
> 
> As with ALL bosses, the tank should be sure to turn the boss AWAY from the group and the group should stay BEHIND the target at all times to prevent being at the end where the teeth are!
> 
> **Slam Attack** - Occasionally the boss will hit with a HUGE swing which hits in frontal aoe. IF you are hit by this you will fly an extremely long way in the air, way off the platform you are fighting him on. All you have to do is simply dodge roll or walk out of the aoe cone and you will be unharmed.
> 
> **Fear** - This is exactly what it says on the tin. Every so often the boss will roar at the group fearing all members into running random directions from the boss for 3-4 seconds. All you need to do in this phase is break free. So long as your maintain your stamina resource for the majority of the fight you will (or should) be able to instantly break free when he fears you. Careful after breaking however because he CAN throw out his Slam Attack straight after to try to get some big hits on the running targets.
> 
> 
> 
> Snagg Gro-Mashul
> 
> 
> ** THE PACK **
> 
> This boss is an arena type scenario where you fight multiple waves of small enemies. Close ranged and long ranged. The group should stay generally central for the waves of enemies and the tank should try to chain/pull in as many ranged as possible so the group can dispatch them fast with aoe damage. Once all waves are dead the 4x bosses will jump into the room. The tank should bring all x4 together and hold them still and try NOT to make any of them face the group.
> 
> NOTE: these bosses CAN be chained, stunned, rooted, cc'd AND health potions will appear on the floor in the fight which you can pick up if you need.
> 
> **Snagg Gro-Mashul** - This boss has an aoe whirlwind like affect from his 2handed weapon, this is small and very easy to avoid by stepping out of it while it is happening. He also heavy attacks with an uppercut so be sure to block this.
> 
> **Nusana** - The boss ill occassoinally cast a nasty line of fire across the floor, this is easy to avoid by simply moving to one side and letting it pass, but if it hits you it will REALLY hurt. Keep your eyes open.
> 
> **Dynus Aralas** - The boss will cast fire and ice abilities including some cc, so be sure to make sure you keep a close eye on this boss so that heals and damage channeling abilities can be bashed/interrupted.
> 
> **Kayd at-Sal** - The boss is like a traditional rogue type, fast attacks and cna make mince meat of a dps. This boss above ALL should be focused and your tank must NOT drop a taunt on this one. He is slippery. If you are a dps and this guy focuses you, stay close to the tank so the tank can regain agro and be sure to block the incoming attacks.
> 
> ALL bosses at 30% turn into werewolves with flurry, heavy attack and pounce knock back abilities.
> 
> 
> 
> Teranya The Faceless
> 
> 
> ** TERANYA THE FACELESS **
> 
> This boss is very simple but does hit very hard. Also in the beginning there are 2 Enraged Durzogs to deal with. If the tank positions the boss facing away from the group and pins down the two Durzogs, they should die to aoe while the boss gradually takes damage. Hold the boss as still as possible.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - Does exactly as it says on the tin. The heavy attack can be blocked and will hit the tank or whoever has agro. No matter what role you are, if this is on you, BLOCK IT. If you don't you will be knocked down and take HUGE damage.
> 
> **Whirlwind** - Basically a steel tornado attack, the boss will spin and anyone caught in the small aoe around it will take physical damage. This is very easy to avoid, when you see the spin coming, step back a couple of feet, and when it is over step back in again.
> 
> **Exploding Banekins** - Throughout the fight Banekins will appear and run at the group, when they get to their target they will explode! This is incredibly dangerous for the dps and these need to be managed. The aoe damage can sometimes be enough to kill them before they are a problem but if not the tank can also pin them while they are trying to run off.
> 
> The safest way to manage this above all is to be sure that the dps and healers are of course behind the boss but not too close (unless melee built) this way the banekins have longer to run and could die before they reach you. However if they do reach you, simply block and/or put up a damage shield and you will be fine.
> 
> 
> 
> INCINERATION BEETLES
> 
> 
> ** THE STINGER, INCINERATION BEETLES & THE TROLL KING **
> 
> This boss is actually 3 waves, one is the fight with 4x incineration beetles, the next is the stinger (scorpion) and then finally the troll king. Your tank needs to pay close attention to these fights and be sure that anything taunted is faced AWAY from the group. DPS and Healers need to focus here because running around the room WILL kill you.
> 
> **Incineration Bettles** - 4x nasty flaming beetles. The tank should try to hold these as still as possible. AOE damage all 4 of them at the same time as much as possible to kill them quickly and evenly. The beetles throughout the fight especially low health will cast a nasty pulsing fire aoe (which burns a LOT) and also place aoe on the ground (more fire) standing in this will be a MESS! Do NOT stand in it and your healer needs to really be on point for the incoming damage if people get caught. The beetles have low health but they can wipe groups. Be careful.
> 
> **Stinger** - This boss is incredibly simple. The tank should face it away from the group, in the mean time block any heavy attacks that come in. When the boss puts his stinger into the ground, one player will be targeted and poison will shoot out from under them to kill them, simply move away from this and do as you were doing. Do not sprint around the room, just move a bit and carry on.
> 
> **The Troll King** - This HUGE and if you understand him he is a bit of a puppy, BUT if you panic and run around the room, you will wipe. Tip..STAY CLOSE!!!
> 
> **JUMP** - This mechanic is simple, if you are too  far away from the boss he will jump on your head. STAY CLOSE
> 
> **Slam** - The boss will hit the ground with a huge slam and be very easy to spot with a large AOE visual. Simple block or step out of it, BUT make sure you get back in position asap so that he doesn't jump at long ranged targets.
> 
> 
> 
> Captain Thoran
> 
> 
> ** CAPTAIN THORAN **
> 
> This boss is so small and squishy but can cause a lot of damage if not dealt with fast. There are many adds in the room and the tank should try to center these in the middle with the boss.
> 
> **Flame runes** - The boss throws flame runes on the floor which burn for HIGH amounts of damage, be sure not to stand in these.
> 
> **Clouds** - Purple clouds will appear randomly in the room, cast from the boss, be sure to avoid these and don't stand in them else they will deal HIGH damage to squishy players.
> 
> **Atronach** - At lot health the boss will spawn a flame atronach. This will give the boss a damage shield.
> 
> So long as you kill the Flame atronach the boss's damage shield will disappear. This is VERY relevant and important to the next boss fight. Remember, when you kill a flame atronach they explode, so don't stand where they died.
> 
> 
> 
> The Lava Queen
> 
> 
> ** THE LAVA QUEEN **
> 
> This one is a tricky one! There is a lot going on and pretty much everything you can see will kill you, Lava kills, fire kills, pools of lava on the floor etc are all dangerous. Tiny pools are not there for fun or part of the scenery, they are HIGH damage areas and you are NOT meant to stand in them. So watch your feet!
> 
> The tank should put the boss as central as possible without standing in the lava and get ready for a world of pain. do NOT drop the boss!
> 
> For all group members, you must find your positions and focus. do NOT dance around the room, you WILL die and it is very hard to recover.
> 
> **Atronachs** - Just like the last boss, atronachs will spawn. During this fight the lesser her health the more atronachs spawn. They will attach a beam to her and render her IMMUNE to ALL damage until the atronachs are dead. You MUST focus those atronachs BUT be sure to follow mechanics because these can overlap with other phases.
> 
> **Heavy Attack** - The boss as a very hard hitting heavy attack! If you block this you will take barely any damage (even a dps can survive) BUT if you miss it, you will fly a LONG way and she will follow up with other light attacks while you are on the ground. The heavy is also delayed animation wise, so be sure that you block as soon as you see her winding it up. It will hit you way before the animation has finished.
> 
> **Eruptions** - randomly during the fight lava pools will erupt and fire into the room, watch your feet and avoid these. They are small aoe but they do hurt a lot!
> 
> **Flame attack** - randomly the boss will fire flame light attacks at the group, usually at the furthest target. So keep your shields up and/or block when you see this coming.
> 
> **The Wheel!** - From a birds eye view this looks like spokes of a wheel. She will stab her sword into the ground and erupt several fast moving lines of fire from her to the edge of the area. These are random in direction but they will constantly fire until she stands up again.
> 
> The trick to this is range! Staying close makes it impossible to have enough time to react. As soon as you see her stab the floor, move backwards and get as much safe distance as possible, watch the flame on the floor and if it is aiming at you,m simply move left and right to avoid it.
> 
> Once the phase is over, get back in again. Getting hit by this will ONE shot a dps or a healer, so spread out, dodge the attacks and come back in...simple..effective, but done wrong, it is devastating.
> 
> Taking off vampire wont save you...THIS will one shot anyone but a tank, and even most of those will die vampire or not. Watch your feet!
> 
> Good luck!
