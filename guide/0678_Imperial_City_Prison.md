## 帝都监狱





### 大魔

> OVERFIEND


**大魔**

这个boss非常简单，但是被低估了！坦克应该让boss背对传送门并保持不动，绝对不能让boss转身。然而，此战的关键是小队应该优先集火小怪，而不是boss！

* **重击跳跃** :  一种非常简单的跳跃/重击攻击方式，目标通常是坦克或者引起敌对注意的人。务必阻挡此攻击，因为它会击倒并造成大量伤害。

* **Flurry** :  这个攻击是Boss面前的锥形AOE，是一种快速攻击。坦克需要格挡这个攻击，否则会很快死亡，并且在这个攻击期间不能让Boss转向。如果治疗或DPS玩家被这个攻击击中，几乎是必死的！

* **出怪** :  在战斗期间，房间里会不断刷新很多出怪。坦克可以将它们连在一起并阻止它们移动，但所有输出职业最重要的是迅速干掉它们，并完全专注于处理出怪，而不是老板。老板的生命值是触发它们的原因，所以如果你把老板推得太快，你很快就会被大量出怪淹没。放缓节奏！如果它们正在施法且不免疫任何控制效果，则可打断它们。它们很容易被处理掉，但是你需要管理的出怪数量越少越好！

* **AOE诅咒** :  这很容易看到，是地上一个大的AOE标记，应该避免站在上面。只需要离开它即可。坦克会活下来，但是DPS和治疗者会受到很大的伤害，特别是如果房间里还有其他小怪的话。

* **收割者** :  当Boss剩余50%的血量及以下时，他会大喊“典狱长，救我！！”当你听到这个声音时，准备好！一个收割者将会从传送门加入战斗。坦克需要尽快抓住她，并与Boss一起抵御，但是一定要确保不要让Boss转身，以防他处于乱舞状态！

收割者必须尽可能地承受伤害！她会在玩家脚下放置AOE，造成巨大的伤害，一旦发射出来，半秒到一秒内就会发射第二个！这个将会杀死你！如果第一个击中了你，你必须几乎立刻翻滚来躲避。

一旦收割者死亡，战斗基本上就是清除小怪并击败首领，没有其他额外的危险。

提示：保留所有大招用于收割者！





### 血肉雕刻者伊波梅兹

> IBOMEZ THE FLESH SCULPTOR


**血肉雕刻者伊波梅兹**

这是一场简单的战斗，但是如果团队不了解机制，情况可能会变得非常糟糕。如果你的伤害很高，相对来说比较安全，但如果不是，你就必须遵守规则，否则会被压垮。坦克应该保持对boss的控制，让团队在boss靠近时尽可能造成伤害。坦克必须不断保持嘲讽效果。如果boss松开了控制，不要在房间里四处奔跑。

* **攻略翻译
上勾拳** :  BOSS会发动一次巨大的重击，并将目标击飞到空中。简单地格挡即可避免被击杀。该攻击仅对坦克造成伤害，因此请确保不要失去嘲讽。但如果你不是坦克，并且BOSS瞄准了你，请格挡即可。

* **囚犯** :  这个首领将会在战斗不同阶段跑到池边，并释放囚犯，他们将会从房间的所有出入口跑来，直奔池塘而来。你的团队必须拆分到房间的四个角落/边上，然后捡起地上的绿色黏液。为了做到这一点，你必须进行协作。一旦你在光标上有目标的 aoe，你必须向囚犯扔球。你杀死的囚犯越多，越好。如果你失败的话，因为太多人掉进池塘，他们就会形成一个血肉元素！如果你击杀囚犯的速度非常缓慢，你最后可能会在房间里面看到4个元素和首领。除非你有一个巨大的 dps 组，否则这是一个非常大的问题。

* **阿特洛克** :  这些必须被摧毁并成为你的首要目标。坦克应尽快吸引它们并把它们叠在BOSS身上。如果一个DPS被其中之一选中，他们只需要格挡就可以了。它们的标准攻击不会太强。惊慌失措的玩家逃跑会导致全灭，因为它们将不易控制。必须聚焦它们的原因是，如果不能足够快地消灭它们，它们会变得狂暴并立即击杀其他人，包括大多数坦克！

* **喷溅** :  首领会朝坦克或小队施放锥形AOE技能，但是由于角度非常小，很容易躲避，只要简单地走出它的范围就可以了。但是这个技能的伤害相当低。

* **嫩化** :  每当BOSS从免疫阶段（犯人阶段）出来时，他会选择小组中的一个随机成员。会出现一条消息，提示他正在“嫩化”小组的成员。这个人将被殴打至倒地。几秒钟后，你可以打断BOSS，阻止他发动致命一击。如果你未能打断，目标将死亡！





### 鬼火哨兵

> GRAVELIGHT SENTRY


翻译： **碎石灯塔哨兵**

这个首领很简单，但是非常灵活。坦克需要尽快抓住首领，并尝试控制他在房间中心，同时掌控几个亡灵法师的仇恨。尽可能让首领保持在中间，以避免过多的毒液游泳！

* **死灵法师** :  房间里有5个死灵法师。必须迅速消灭他们。如果他们开始咏唱/施法，必须打断。每次未能打断将导致一个额外的骷髅进入房间，你必须应对它！

* **大爆炸** :  BOSS将进行一次巨大的AOE旋转和击退攻击，击中的所有成员将被向后抛出数英尺，90％的时间会将人们推入毒液中。不要因为好玩而在毒液中游泳，认为自己能够幸免，赶紧离开！

* **光束** :  首领会瞄准拥有仇恨的玩家（通常是坦克），并向他们瞄准三束绿色光束并缩小距离。这些可以被封锁和/或躲避，但如果你没有封锁，就可能会被晕眩/失去平衡。如果可以的话，避免这些攻击。

* **毒气炸弹** :  整个战斗期间你需要不停地移动。房间内的毒气会喷出毒雾/炸弹，落在地上会形成相当大的范围伤害，并且会晕眩你！尽可能避开这些攻击，但如果你一定会被攻击到，只需格挡即可减少伤害并避免被晕眩。需要用格挡来防御，而不是翻滚，这样会耗费更少的体力。这些毒气炸弹发射速度非常快，会一直存在于整个战斗中。





### 血肉憎恶

> FLESH ABOMINATION


** 血肉畸形 **

这个Boss非常巨大，攻击力很强，拥有一些非常严苛的机制，即使最好的玩家也会被抓住。他的生命值不是很大，但房间非常广阔，机制需要你使用整个房间。坦克应该把Boss转向悬崖的一侧，尽可能在房间的那一侧坦克，给其他三个成员尽可能多的空间。

* **攻略如下
霍瓦斯** :  游戏一开始会出现两只霍瓦斯，整个战斗中它们会轮流出现。你必须集中攻击它们，绝不能让两只霍瓦斯同时存在。它们在地上放置的毒液会造成非常高的伤害，如果你在里面逗留时间超过几秒钟，就会死亡。如果你被两个毒液放置重叠的AOE同时攻击，几乎肯定会死亡！消灭霍瓦斯！

* **重型攻击** :  这个BOSS会不断地对坦克发动一系列大型攻击。你可以格挡这些攻击，但大多数时候仍然会偶尔将你击倒，以模拟他有多么强大和巨大，因此要站稳脚跟。如果他将你击退，请尽力保持原地，不要让他在房间里跳跃。尽可能地控制你的坦克区域，让他处于你小组的效果范围之内。

* **Hoarvor Splat** :  当boss偶尔跑到房间中央时，4只Hoarvor会冲向小队成员。这时，要<b>散开</b>！每个人要快速找到自己的角落。它们造成很高的伤害，你不想被它们碾压或重叠。当boss猛击地面时，所有Hoarvor都会被他的冲击波击败，然后你可以像平常一样继续战斗。

* **毒药和不死亡灵** :  BOSS 偶尔会强制在每个小队成员身上施加毒药范围伤害。 快速分散并找到一个不重叠的位置。这些药雾会爆炸并使每个玩家倒地。其中一个玩家会被困在一片区域内，这片区域的毒药效果会一直持续。

这个群攻技能非常致命，外围不断喷溅毒液的环带非常危险。你必须待在攻击范围内，不能接触环带外侧的毒液。如果你碰到边缘，就会立即死亡。

在这个阶段，首领将把双手伸入地面，并且在引导这个效果时不会攻击坦克。此外，不死敌人也会出现，需要被消灭。它们的生命值很低，所以很容易处理，但最重要的是，任何玩家都不应该触碰毒环。一旦它消失，战斗就会像平常一样继续。





### 帝都监狱。

> LORD WARDEN'S


** 典狱长的护卫 **

这场战斗比看起来的要轻松得多。有四个护卫，每个都有自己的机制。坦克应该抓住所有四个敌人，并试图将它们叠放在死灵法师身上。整个过程都要保持仇恨，并集中精力不要让近战敌人面向团队。团队应该持续打断治疗护卫，同时集中攻击另外三个。

* **Necromancer** :  这个护卫会召唤骷髅小兵，还能从地上召唤一种图腾/水晶类型的物品。如果出现了这个物品，你必须在继续战斗之前将其消灭，否则所有敌人将只受到微小的伤害（约为你平时造成的10%）。这就是为什么你要先集中火力攻击Necromancer，用终极技能迅速击杀他，图腾就不是问题了。但如果出现了图腾，你必须消灭它。

* **狂战士** :  双持近战类型，生命值非常低，容易被击杀，但要小心他的钢铁龙卷风！一定要格挡。

* **骑士** :  这个家伙打击力并不强，但他有一个令人讨厌的冲锋能力，可以把碰到的人震倒。坦克可以简单地阻挡这个攻击，但其他人应该走开避让。

* **治疗师** :  非常简单，这位会进行治疗，请在他尝试治疗时打断他并最后将他击败 (如果有可能的话)。

* **来世** :  所有的首领会以幽灵的形式回来。所以如果可能的话，你希望按照特定顺序将它们消灭。死灵法师将以幽灵形式出现，并不能对小组造成太多伤害。狂战士会回来，并挥舞武器攻击他喜欢的人，骑士会选择一个目标冲上去攻击，而治疗师会进行治疗...

由于它们是幽灵，所以无法与它们互动！不能伤害它们，不能嘲讽它们，也无法格挡它们！

这点非常重要。如果骑士向你冲过来或狂战士在旋转，迅速躲出范围之外，你无法通过任何方式减轻它的伤害！

很明显，我们最后击杀治疗师的原因是因为当他变成幽灵时我们无法打断他的治疗技能。这样做可以避免问题。





### 黄昏典狱官大君

> LORD WARDEN DUSK


** 多斯克典狱长**

这可能是游戏中最酷的战斗！

这里同时存在许多机制，你必须全神贯注并与队伍协调。坦克必须始终保持BOSS的仇恨，每个人都必须注意自己的位置并进行沟通。将自己分为两个团队。一个治疗和DPS，一个坦克和DPS，并留在分配好的团队中。这在我们到达传送门机制时会更加明显。这是一次极具移动性的战斗，BOSS将会经常传送，因此，通过正确计时使用终极技能等非常重要！

* **瞬间传送跳跃攻击** :  Boss将对拥有仇恨（一般是坦克）的人放出一个沉重攻击。他会跳起来，消失，让你处于晕眩状态，然后在着陆时对你进行沉重攻击。当你处于晕眩状态时，解除这个状态并且保持格挡以减轻攻击造成的伤害。即使作为DPS或治疗者，采用这种解除状态和格挡的方法也不会对你造成太多的伤害。因此，请确保按照这个机制行动。

* **消耗气泡** :  Boss 偶尔会从地面上拉出蓝色气泡，并将其放置在他选择的房间位置。战斗时间越长，气泡就越多，所以小心你站在哪里。如果你靠近气泡，它们会使你减速并迅速消耗你的生命值！

* **陨石** :  在战斗中，陨石会掉落在随机组成员的头上。我看到很多人试图闪避这些陨石，但要么失败，要么浪费了很多资源。如果被击中，它们会使您晕眩，但如果您简单地<b>格挡</b>，您将减少很多伤害并忽略晕眩。在这里使用格挡更有利于您的资源，要养成习惯。战斗时间越长，陨石掉落得越快，所以要注意它们。

* **机枪** :  Boss会把手放在一起，对他选择的一个玩家进行快速连发的机枪魔法攻击。此时仇恨值不起作用，坦克和目标必须进行配合！目标需要站在坦克的后面，而坦克则要挡住攻击。这是完全基于视线的，如果坦克在前，而目标在后，他们就会安全，但是如果你从坦克后面探出头，或者甚至站在坦克前面或逃跑，你就会死！坦克必须是你的物理屏障，并挡在它的前面！

* **传送门** :  整场战斗中，首领会召唤出 2 个传送门。你们在合适的时候一定不要去碰它们，无论如何都要避免它们，但一定要确保你们的队伍分成两组。原因是因为每个传送门有两条生命线！如果有两个人同时进去，其他人就不能进去，传送门将消失。如果有人在战斗中单独进去了而没有承认自己犯了错误，当两个人后来尝试进去时，只剩下一条生命线...那么就会有人死亡！

如果有队友在错误的时间站错了位置，让另一个队友故意站在同一个传送门上。这样会清除它，典狱长会重新发出一个传送门。

现在这些传送门的重要性在于，当它决定在竞技场旁边高高飞起，扇动翅膀时...它即将向整个房间释放大量能量爆发。这将一击必杀房间内的每个玩家...除非你走进传送门。

进入传送门后一定要在下降过程中激活保护协作攻击，并在最终安全降落后重新强化/治疗等以减弱危险。

他之后会再次生成更多的传送门，而你需要重复这个过程。记住，不要不小心使用传送门，你需要它们来对抗他飞入空中后的攻击。

* **幽影** :  Boss 在血量降至65%和35%时会消失到中心，屏幕四周会出现4个他的影子。这些影子必须被击杀，但是只能杀死实体的影子，透明的那些无法被杀。并且它们会不断切换。

坦克必须迅速嘲讽所有的对手，以使团队免受魔法攻击，否则你将会很快被击败。如果坦克拥有仇恨，不时吸收魔法能量将实际上吸收攻击并治愈坦克。在保持嘲讽和吸收魔法的情况下，坦克基本上会变得不死并完全掌控。请注意，这些阴影有巨大的打击范围，可以用近战技能如嘲讽和重型攻击从非常远的地方攻击它们。作为DPS或治疗者，利用这个阶段（只要坦克控制得当）来恢复资源和/或积累终极技。你不必迅速消灭这些影子，只需慢慢杀死它们并利用它们来积累能量即可。

一旦所有幽灵都被消灭，典狱长大人就会再次出现在房间中央（尽管偶尔他会偷偷传送到一侧）。

* **所有机制都一直存在但由于65** : 35％阶段，如果您可以快速将Boss推到65-35-0，可能会杀死Boss，而不需要进行传送门跳跃阶段，但这需要一些练习。学习机制，坚持遵循，熟悉它们，您就会没问题。

祝你好运！

> 
> This boss is a very simple one but is heavily underestimated! The tank should hold the boss still with their back to the portal and NEVER spin the boss around. The key point to this fight however is that the group should focus the adds first, not the boss!
> 
> **Heavy Attack/Jump** - A very simple jump/heavy attack which will be aimed at the tank or whoever has agro. Be sure to block this as it does knock down and a LOT of damage.
> 
> **Flurry** - This attack is a cone aoe in front of the boss and is a rapid hitting flurry attack. The tank needs to BLOCK this or die incredibly fast and must NOT spin the boss around during this attack. If a healer or dps player is caught by this, it is pretty much guaranteed death!
> 
> **Adds** - During the fight there will be many adds spawning in the room. The tank can of course chain these in and root them but above all the dps should dispatch them quickly and put full focus on the adds, NOT the boss. The boss health is what triggers them, so if you push the boss too far, you will be overwhelmed with adds quickly. Pace it! The adds can be interrupted if they are casting and are not immune to any cc. They are easy to get rid of but the less you have to manage with the better!
> 
> **AOE Curse** - This is pretty easy to see, a BIG aoe on the ground which should be avoided. Simply stay out of it. The tank will survive but the dps and healers will take a lot of damage especial if there are adds in the room.
> 
> **Harvester!** - At 50% health and below the boss will shout 'lord Warden, Aid Me!!' When you hear this GET READY! A harvester is going to be joining the fight from the portal. The tank needs to grab her as soon as possible and hold her with the boss, BUT must be sure NOT to spin the boss around in case he is in flurry mode!
> 
> The harvester must be focused with as much damage as possible! She will place aoe's under players feet which deal MASSIVE damage, and once it has fired, within half a second to a second will fire a second one! This one will kill you! If the first one hits you, you must dodge roll almost instantly when you spot it.
> 
> Once the harvester is dead, the fight is basically just finish the adds and the boss with no other additional danger.
> 
> TIP: save all ultimates for the harvester!

> 
> This is a simple fight which can con horribly wrong if the group is not sure of mechanics. If you have high damage you are relatively safe but if not, you will have to stick to the rules or get overwhelmed. The tank should hold the boss very still while the group do as much damage as possible while he is in the face of the group. The tank must NOT drop taunt. If the boss does go loose do NOT run around the room.
> 
> **Uppercut** - The boss fire a HUGE heavy attack and know the target up into the air. Simply block this to avoid it killing you. It should only be hitting the tank, so be sure you don't drop taunt. But if you are not a tank and it is aiming at you, block and you will be fine.
> 
> **Inmates!** - The boss throughout stages of the fight will run to the pool and inmates will flood the room running from all of the door ways aiming straight from the pool. Your group must split up into 4 corners/sides of the room and pick up the green piles of goo on the floor. To do this you must synergize them. Once you have the target aoe on your cursor, you have to THROW the ball AT the inmates. The more inmates you kill the better. If you fail miserably you will be in trouble since if too many fall into the pool they will create a Flesh Atronach! If you are really slow at killing the inmates, you can end up with as many as 4x Atronachs in the room AND the boss. Unless you have a HUGE dps group, this is a very big problem.
> 
> **Atronachs** - These MUST be destroyed and are your primary focus. The tank should grab these as soon as possible and stack them on the boss. If a dps is being targeted by one of these all they need to do is block. They do not hit too hard with standard attacks. Panicking players running away will cause a wipe because they will be very difficult to control. The reason these MUST be focused is because if they are NOT killed fast enough they will enrage and one shot kill people one after the other, INCLUDING most tanks!
> 
> **Spray!** - The boss will cast a cone shaped aoe at the tank/group, this is easy to avoid since it is such a small angle, simply step out of it. The damage is quite low however.
> 
> **Tenderize** - Every time the boss comes out of his immunity stage (inmates) he will choose a random member of the group. A message will appear saying that he is 'tenderizing' a member of the group. This person is getting beaten to the ground. After a couple of seconds you can INTERRUPT the boss and stop him from firing his finishing blow. If you fail to interrupt it, the target is DEAD!
> 
> 
> 
> GRAVELIGHT SENTRY
> 
> 
> ** GRAVELIGHT SENTRY **
> 
> This boss is simple but VERY mobile. The tank needs to grab the boss as soon as possible and try to control him in the center of the room while grabbing agro on a couple of necromancers. Keep the boss in the middle as much as possible to avoid too much poison swimming!
> 
> **Necromancers** - There are 5 necromancers around the room. These must be killed quickly. If they start channeling/casting they MUST be interrupted. Every failed interrupt will result in an additional skeleton entering the room and you will have to deal with it!
> 
> **Big BOOM!** - The boss will do a huge aoe spin and knock back attack which will throw all members hit by it several feet backwards, 90% of the time pushing people into the poison. Do NOT swim in the poison for fun and think you will get away with it, get OUT FAST!
> 
> **Beams** - The boss will aim at the player with agro (should be the tank) aiming 3 green beams at them which close in together. These can be blocked and/or walked out of but if you are not blocking you can be stunned/knocked off balance by them. Avoid these if possible.
> 
> **Poison Bombs** - During the entire fight you want to keep moving. The poison around the room is firing out poison splashes/bombs which land in the room and make a rather large aoe on the ground which will stun you! Avoid these as much as possible but if you are definitely going to get caught by one, simply BLOCK and you will mitigate the damage and avoid the stun. Block these, NOT dodge roll and it will cost a lot less stamina, these fire very fast and are present throughout the entire fight.
> 
> 
> 
> FLESH ABOMINATION
> 
> 
> ** FLESH ABOMINATION **
> 
> This boss is very large, hits pretty hard and has some rather unforgiving mechanics which catch out even the best of players. His health is not huge but the room is massive and the mechanics make you use the whole room. The tank should turn the boss to the edge where the cliff is and try to tank on that side of the room giving the other 3 members as much space as possible.
> 
> **Hoavors** - At the very beginning there will be two Hoarvors, and through out the fight one at a time spawning. These MUST be focused. You never want to have 2x Hoarvors alive at once. The poison they put on the floor does crazy high damage and if you stay in it for more than a couple of seconds you are dead. If you get caught by  2x poison aoes stacking on each other, that is almost certain death! Kill the Hoavors!
> 
> **Heavy attacks** - The boss will constantly be hitting the tank with a barrage of large attacks. You can block these but most of them will still occasionally knock you down to simulate just how big he is and how much strength he has, so plant your feet and if he knocks you back, hold your position as much as you can to keep him from dancing around the room. Try to manage your tanking area as much as you can and keep him in the dots from your group.
> 
> **Hoarvor Splat!** - The boss will occasionally run to the middle of the room, and 4x Hoarvors will run to the group members. When this happens, SRPEAD OUT! Everyone find their own coner fast. These deal high damage and you don't want to get caught by them OR overlap them. When the boss smashes the ground all Hoavors will be splattered by his ground impact and then you can continue the fight as normal.
> 
> **Poison and undead Minions!** - The boss occasionally will force poison aoe's on to each member of the group. Spread out FAST and get a clean location without overlapping any of them. They will explode and each player will be knocked down. ONE player, will be put inside of an aoe which is staying ON the ground.
> 
> This aoe is deadly, there is an outer ring to it pulsing with spluttering poison. you must stay INSIDE the aoe and must NOT touch the ring of poison on the outside of it. If you touch the edges you are dead.
> 
> During this phase the boss will have his hands dug into the ground and he will not be attacking the tank while channeling this effect. Also undead enemies will appear which need to be killed. They have low health so are easy to deal with but above all, NO player should touch the poison ring. Once it has gone, the fight continues as normal.
> 
> 
> 
> LORD WARDEN'S
> 
> 
> ** LORD WARDEN'S BODYGUARDS **
> 
> This fight is no where near as scary as it looks. There are 4 Body guards and each have their own individual mechanics. The tank should grab all 4 enemies and try to stack them on the Necromancer. Hold agro the entire time and focus on NOT facing the melee enemies at the group. The group should keep interrupts on the healer bodyguard while focusing down the other 3.
> 
> **Necromancer** - This body guard summons skeletal minions and also a totem/crystal type item out of the ground. If this happens you MUST kill it before continuing in the fight else all Enemies will take TINY damage (about 10% of your usual output). This is why you want to focus the Necromancer first, Kill him quickly with ultimates and the totem will be no problem. But in the event of it spawning you MUST kill it.
> 
> **Berserker** - Dual wield melee type, very low health easy to kill, but watch for his steel tornado! Be sure to block it.
> 
> **Knight** - This guy doesn't hit very hard at all, but he does have a nasty charge ability which will knock down anyone caught in it's path. The tank can simply block this but other should walk out of it.
> 
> **Healer** - Very simple, this guy heals, interrupt him every time he tries and kill him LAST if you can help it.
> 
> **AFTERLIFE!!!** - ALL bosses will come back in the form of a ghost. SO this is why you want them dead in a certain order if you can help it. The necromancer will be in ghost form and not really do mch to the group. The berserker will come back and steel tornado whoever he likes and the knight will charge the target of his choice while the healer heals...
> 
> Since they are ghosts, they cannot be interacted with! Cannot hurt them, cannot taunt them and cannot BLOCK THEM!
> 
> This is crucial to note. If the knight is charging you or the berserker is spinning, get OUT of the aoe, you cannot mitigate it in anyway!
> 
> And clearly the reason we kill the healer last is because we cannot interrupt his heals when he is a ghost. So that saves issues for you.
> 
> 
> 
> LORD WARDEN DUSK
> 
> 
> ** LORD WARDEN DUSK**
> 
> This is quite possibly the coolest fight in the game!
> 
> There are lots of mechanics going on at once here and you must pay full attention and co-ordinate with the group. The tank needs to keep agro on the boss at ALL times, everyone must watch their feet and you need to communicate. Split yourself into two teams. One healer and dps and one tank and dps, and stay with your assigned team. This will make more sense once we get to the portal mechanic. This is a very mobile fight and the boss will teleport a lot so timing your ultimates etc is key!
> 
> **Teleport Jump Attack** - The boss will fire a heavy attack at the person with agro (should be the tank). He will jump in the air, vanish, stun you and then when he lands he will heavy attack you. When you are stunned break free and hold block to mitigate this hit. Even as a dps or healer, applying this break free and block will not do much damage to you at all. So just be sure to follow the mechanic.
> 
> **Drain Bubbles** - The boss will occasionally pull blue orbs out from the ground and they will be situated in the room in places of his choice. The longer the fight the more of these you will get so be careful where you stand. If you go near them, they will snare you, and drain your health rapidly!
> 
> **Meteors** - During the fight meteors will land on random group members heads. I see a lot of people trying to dodge roll these and either failing or just wasting a lot of resources. They will stun you if they hit you but if you simply BLOCK, you will mitigate a lot of damage and ignore the stun. Blocking is better for your resources, make it a habit in here to get used to. The longer the fight the faster the meteors come down though so be aware of them.
> 
> **Machine Gun!** - The boss will put his hands together and launch a rapid firing machine gun type magic attack at a player of HIS choice. This is where agro makes NO difference and the tank and the target must co-ordinate together! The target needs to position BEHIND the tank while the tank blocks the attacks. This is 100% line of sight based. If the tank is in front and the target behind, they will be safe, if you peek out from behind the tank or even stand in front of the tank or run away you WILL die! The tank has to be your physical shield and get in the way of it!
> 
> **Portals!** - The boss throughout the fight will spawn 2x portals. You must NOT touch these until the right moment, avoid them at all costs, but be sure to have your group split into two teams. The reason for the teams is because EACH portal has 2 lives! If two people go in, no one else can and it will vanish. If one person goes in during the fight without admitting they made a mistake, when 2 people try to get it later, only one life will be left...someone is gona die!
> 
> IF someone makes a mistake and stands in one at the wrong time, get your team mate to deliberately do the same to the same portal. This will get rid of it and lord warden will issue a fresh one.
> 
> Now the reason these portals are important is because when he decides to go up HIGH in the air, flapping his wings at the side of the arena...he is about to issue a massive burst of energy to the entire room. THIS will one shot every player in the room...UNLESS you get in the portal.
> 
> Once inside the portal be sure to activate the protection synergy one the way down, and when you finally land to safety, rebuff/heal etc to take the edge off.
> 
> He will later respawn more portals and you will have to repeat this process again. Remember, don't accidentally use the portals, you need them for when he goes up in the air.
> 
> **Shades** - At 65% health and 35% health the boss will vanish into the middle and 4 shadows of him will appear around the room. These must be killed but only the SOLID one can be killed. The transparent ones cannot be killed. And they will switch from one to the other.
> 
> The tank must taunt all of these fast to get the magic shots off of the group or you will wipe fast. If the tank has agro, absorb magicka once every so often will actually absorb the shots and heal the tank. Following this clean keeping up taunts and Absorb magicka spams will basically render the tank immortal and in full control. Note these shades have MASSIVE hit boxes and can be hit with melee abilities like taunts and heavy attacks from a VERY long way away. As a dps and/or healer, use this phase (so long as the tank has everything under control) to get back resources and/or build ultimate. You do not have to NUKE the shades, you can simply kill tem slowly and use them to build.
> 
> Once the shades are all dead, Lord Warden will appear again in the middle of the room (although OCCASIONALLY he does a sneaky teleport to the side).
> 
> All of the mechanics are present all of the time however due to the 65 - 35% stages it is POSSIBLE to kill the boss so fast that you never get a portal jump phase if you can push him to 65 - 35 - 0 fast enough, but THAT will take some practice. Learn the mechanics, stick to them, get comfortable with them and you will be just fine.
> 
> Good luck out there!!
